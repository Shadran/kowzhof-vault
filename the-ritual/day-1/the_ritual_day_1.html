			<p>Your mind is still foggy, a cold mid-november night you are trying to stumble through as you walk out of your cell. An irresistible pull guides you through blurry corridors, shapes moving alongside in the corners of your vision. Stones, wood, mold and dust illuminated by the orange light of the torches. A rat, squirming out of the way and clawing at the wall before hiding in the shadows. Chains of irons, hanging to the ceiling. Still and silent, they are still echoing the screams of those who had the misfortune of experiencing their company. You take one step after another, your advance not slowing down a bit. A single, lone thought fluttering through your mind is spared by the haze clutching your consciousness: where are you?</p>
			<p>You find yourself in front of a flight of stairs, waiting for you like protruding fingers of wood nailed onto dull gray rocks with bent iron stakes. They creak under your weight, but surprisingly hold as you begin your ascent. Slowly, your consciousness begins to retake hold. You recognize others, a multitude of different beings of all sorts. Like moths to a flame, you all crowd in front of a closed gate.
			_ _</p>

			<p>A five-arched tympanum oversees the stone double-door before you. Upon each arch, a cast of unidentifiable characters tells a story you cannot read. Statuettes of robed women and knights in engraved armor wield torches and blades against a menagerie of monsters, until the final arch, whose entire length is crammed with wicked faces, tendrils, and disembodied organs carved into stone. The doors below bear similarly foreboding symbolism engraved into either side. An ornately decorated bronze crank sits adjacent to the left door, embedded into the wall; and as the doors have been left partially opened, you may surmise that the unimaginably heavy stone blocks part by way of being pulled into their respective walls. Through the gap between doors, you smell blood as thickly as you might smell saltwater in a seabreeze.</p>
			<p>You enter. Pitch darkness surrounds a spot of dull sunlight in the center of the room. At the light’s fringe, a semicircle of six columns rounds the opposite side of a raised dais across from you. Up seven steps, a stone chair sits upon the dais. Looming behind the chair, you see it, the source of stench: a wreath of organs strung together in dripping, pulsing red tubage suspends itself from the rearmost columns. Lumps like hearts and pus-filled tumors pump and squelch. Unspeakable fluids squirt and spatter. Tangled flesh ripples. The splashing of your footfalls only now becomes apparent to you, and you look down to find that you’ve stepped into a lake of blood spanning the entire illuminated portion of the room and into the impenetrable dark. Piles of fallen flesh stand from the pool, trailing viscera up unto the ceiling from whence they had slumped. Lattice-like patterns of fleshy cordage spread from the wreath and its piles all the way to the top of the tower—a hundred meters overhead or more—to where the open frame of a shattered stained glass window lets in sunlight.
			_ _</p>

			<p>There, right past the throne oozing with red, stands a hunched figure draped in black. His deformed body twists as he turns towards you, an unnaturally wide smile forming on his face in greeting.</p>
			<p>“Oh, Wretched One! Here come your guests, the ones you chose and the ones I delivered! Your humble servant will make sure that they treat you well!”</p>
			<p>His bulging eyes scan the room, pausing on each of you for just a chilling, long moment before moving to the next one. His white teeth shine with reflected red. “The Ritual is upon you, my friends. With you all gathered here, we can finally begin! <strong>It</strong> has chosen you and now you must oblige.”</p>
			<p>The man takes a few steps down the stairs, his left foot coming to a stop with a squash against a lump of sopping flesh. “I am The Keeper. And my duty here is to perform this Ritual, as I did the last and as I will the next. Do not try to seek help, do not try to leave. Only <strong>It</strong> can bring you back from where it took you, and not satisfying its requests would be a grave mistake.”</p>
			<p>“But enough of this introduction,” the deformed man announces with boney arms raised, “You ought to know what kind of role you will play in all of this!”
			_ _</p>

			<p>“At day, you will be guests. The Castle is open for you to do as you please, and it’s furnished with all you might need from food to lodgings to spare weapons. The forest outside the main gate is an excellent place to gather your thoughts but do not wander too far. <strong>It</strong> won’t allow you to.”</p>
			<p>“And when night falls, that’s when you will finally take your rightful place in The Ritual. As Executioners… or as Sacrifices.” His speech breaks into crazed fits of laughter, barely stifled as he tries to reign in the obvious excitement that has overtaken his body. “You are <strong>Its</strong> chosen beings! Grab the heads of your peers, slice their throats, offer their lives to <strong>It</strong> and <strong>It</strong> will be satisfied, once more, and resume <strong>Its</strong> slumber! Fail, and <strong>It</strong> will come to take what rightfully belongs to <strong>It</strong>.”</p>
			<p>“The Ritual will proceed as follows. <strong>One</strong> must perish on the First Night. <strong>One</strong> must perish on the Second Night. <strong>Two</strong> must perish on the Final Night. Failing will force you to sacrifice more and more, until these halls are all soaked in your blood!” With a final step down into the puddle of blood beneath, he rips a strand of warped flesh from one of the pillars, squashing it in his hand. “Sacrificing more will certainly please <strong>It</strong>, but the Ritual will still continue… even if there are not enough of you left!”</p>
			<p>“Now go and do what you must! Prepare! Decide! Scheme! Your humble servant will be back soon, ready to conduct you into the night. Hopefully, you’ll be ready as well.” After drinking from the blood from the organ he had just torn apart, The Keeper’s flesh begins to melt. “Ah! Loved One! Wretched One! My body belongs to your repulsive halls!” He seems to be in agonizing pain as he contorts, his voice fading away into sloshing sounds and then silence.
			_ _</p>

			<p>“Oh dear!” Exclaims a gnome, seeing the doll calling out someone’s name. “Your fabric will certainly become stained in a place such as this!” She says as she hurries over, which is not a very speedy process, provided that she is trudging through a waist-deep pool.</p>
			<p>Regardless, once she reaches the doll, she hums in a noise of concern. She looks the doll over, although it appears that her eyes are closed, or near closed. “Oh, that will not do… I hope you have some way of cleansing yourself, lest your body come to match your hair!”</p>

He juggles the three pieces briefly before collecting them in one hand, closing it, and opening it only to reveal the same taffy that the doll gave him. &quot;It would seem that I can do that.

			<p>You move up the stairs, reaching a circular mezzanine above the throne room. Guarded by statues wielding an assortment of weapons, the railed overhang gives the impression of guarding the upstairs from the darkness below. A quick look around reveals more doors, one of which invitingly ajar.</p>
			<p>As you force this oaken door open against the will of its squealing hinges, sunlight beams across the floor beside you, spreading gradually until at last the door is opened and you are bathed in warmth. Illuminated in a fuzzy yellow-orange gradient, the chamber before you consists of dozens of wooden cots dressed in myriad-colored quilts crammed tightly together along the walls on either side of you. Numerous shelves and bedside tables of uneven construction surround the cots, and each such shelf is filled with books, inkwells, wooden dolls, and various homemade tools and toys. Following the walls, you lose count of all the different colorful banners and woven tapestries hanging in uneven rows between each of the room’s arched windows all the way to the room’s opposite end. At the end, a glass door nearly as tall as the room itself casts its sunlight shadow over everything in the room. The door’s glass panes are so brightly lit that they glow opaque white and grant the door itself a golden corona.</p>
			<p>The bedroom rests on a white brick floor full of divots and hills. The surfaces of the room’s walls bulge in places where their incongruent bricks have slipped partially out of place. Even the vaulted ceiling so far above your head swerves slightly along its length like the spine and ribs of some vast serpent. But the room’s sole hanging light fixture—an unlit cage chandelier, built of wooden spokes—floats motionlessly in the air. This place has not shifted in an age.</p>

			<p>&quot;So your 'Omniframe' is not synthetic, but you are designed as... some sort of living... mechanism? What an ominous answer.&quot; He chuckles slightly.</p>

It was designed by myself, if I may add. Most of my body has been replaced by my own mechanisms, though ultimately... I am still human, I suppose.&quot; There is a tinge of something in his echoing voice.</p>
			<p>&quot;I'm afraid that my curiosity is not quite satisfied. What exactly is an 'Omniframe,' as you so stated? If I were to guess, I suppose it would be something like the inner, fundamental form of your body... though that is not very helpful for my conceptualization.&quot;</p>

			<p>Lucifer eyes the lifted arm intently, but is otherwise silent and still.</p>
			<p>&quot;Omniframe is the name I have given to my frame. I possess no brain or central nervous system in this form. Any portion of my mass can contain or divide my consciousness. Effectively, my body is my brain, translated into biological terms.&quot;</p>
			<p>Lucifer holds up her own non-cannon arm this time, moving it around as various shapes and features form and disappear along its metallic outer layer. Examples of its texture shifting, blades forming, and even bending its shape are shown. &quot;Clarification, I am comprised of tightly bound elements. This is a simplification.&quot;  She lets her statement hang for a few seconds before adding, &quot;Chemical synthesis was not utilized. I am almost entirely a manipulated concentration of Lithium, Carbon, and Silicone.&quot;</p>
			<p>Her arm lowers as her demonstration stops. &quot;I transferred my consciousness from my flesh and blood body to this Omniframe. I have been in this form for centuries... If you have further inquiries of my Omniframe let me know. Afterwards, elaborate on your own form. Its construction, reasoning behind its design, its purpose, side effects, and your voice.&quot;</p>

										<div class='conversation-post-body'>
			<p>&quot;So you were once of flesh and blood, and your mind was transferred into your Omniframe hundreds of years ago. Intriguing. Perhaps when I return home, I'll take some time to research that. Your material's ability to change form is particularly interesting.&quot;</p>
			<p>&quot;As for my own form, I suppose it is rather... analogue, compared to yours. It is composed of magisteel so as to be more conducive for spellcasting, as well as to protect myself from injury. Metals worn by spellcasters are usually a significant hindrance to the flow of magic, but quite the opposite is true for magicite. The alloy of magisteel I use contains 22% magicite, which retains the magic-conducting properties of magicite with most of the durability of common carbon steel.&quot;</p>
			<p>&quot;Most of my body can be perhaps thought of as simple prostheses that are beneficial for the conduction of magic, though my arms and hands are more designed, as the hands are a key component for spellcasting. Simply put, my arms store and consume material components required for spellcasting, transferring them directly to my hands. Through this, the components are more efficiently weaved with magic into spells through movements of my hands.&quot;</p>
			<p>&quot;As for side effects... I rarely hunger or thirst, and I require almost no sleep. I do not get hot or cold, unless the temperature is so extreme as to damage magisteel. I suppose anything a regular human requires to live, I require... less of it.&quot; He pauses for a moment. &quot;As for my voice, my voice has always been rather deep, and my mask has only amplified its magnitude, so to speak.&quot;</p>
			<p>&quot;Ultimately, the purpose for this was, ah... to become stronger. There are things that I must do that require strength. I... did not have the strength I do now when I was of pure flesh and blood.&quot;</p>

			<p>Mademoiselle’s acknowledgement of their darkened expression only goes so far as her lackadaisical smile widening ever so slightly. She gracefully extends out her free hand and attempts to caress Lucifer’s face gently, noting the sense of friction with her soft fingertips if allowed.</p>

			<p>Lucifer does not flinch, let alone pull back. Y'vvtal would note that Lucifer's skin is surprisingly lifelike. Smooth with a little give; cool, yet not devoid of the warmth of life.</p>
			<p>Her eyes shift from Y'vvtal's hand, down her arm, and back to her face. &quot;Yes. If I must exterminate, I want that decision to be informed.&quot;</p>

			<p>Lucifer's chest possesses a lightly radiating warmth and is much harder than her face. While not exactly like any metal Y'vvtal would be familiar with, it is much more akin to steel than it is flesh. A few moments of silence fills the air before Lucifer replies. &quot;Cursed is apt. If I fail in my mission, tragic, too. However, evidence suggests the future I desire exists... I have received your sympathy before your name. What do I call you? As well, tell me of your Lucifer and your thoughts.&quot;</p>

			<p>&quot;I am a monk trained in such arts,  I can offer you great assistance with regards to the various rites and rituals you will need to perform! For a small fee, of course. To cover... expenses, you know?&quot;</p>

			<p>Solomos stands above the man, crossing his arms. &quot;You think of money, even in a situation like this?&quot; He looks down at the man for a moment. &quot;Admirable, perhaps... or perhaps more ignorant. Stand, monk. I have not come here of my own accord. I was summoned, taken, much like how I assume you were. I will not be needing your assistance with 'rites and rituals,' as you say, as I suspect there is nothing I can do to cleanse this place as I am now.&quot;</p>

			He looks at the various pieces of viscera strewn around the room.

			<p>&quot;Pickpocketed, perhaps... kidnapped too, as it seems.&quot; With several clicks and whirrs, he stops doing whatever he's doing with his arm and lowers it, the surface of his bicep sliding back into place. &quot;I suppose our hosts are not above petty theft.

			<p>“Well, the variety of the room’s company does suggest we’ve all been sequestered away from the far reaches of space and time.

			<p>&quot;Yes, imagine a point in space where the weight of a planet is condenced into the smallest point you can think. It is so dense that as you can see with my head.

The air at the cannon's end begins to rapidly chill and freeze, coating the tip of her arm and floor in minuscule ice crystals. As suddenly as they appeared, a sweltering heat melts the ice, forming a small puddle that soon after evaporates into steam.</p>

			<p>At the sound of The Grand Sorcerer’s voice, a tiny gnome grit her teeth slightly and raised her hands up to her ears. After he finished, she gazed up at him, a smile returning to her face, although it seemed to be a somewhat hesitant one. “Your voice is quite powerful. It certainly matches the appearance!” She points out. “If I may request, could you perhaps quiet it slightly…? I am quite prone to headaches, you see…”</p>

			<p>“Perhaps a search party of sorts is called for. To investigate our surroundings. This is after all not the first ritual of its kind. Whatever traces are left here from rituals past may just foretell what is truly in store for us next, no?”</p>

			<p>“Oh, you mean cheese? Don’t mind if i do.

We’d be lucky if there’s even a kitchen in this hellhole. They better not serve us rats to eat. Man… that creep is SO getting it next time I see him.”</p>
			<p>Eventually she loosens up and returns her warm focus on the frenchwoman. “Wanna see if we can find a place to start a fire at least?”</p>

			<p>Mademoiselle does not return Daphne’s look of dismay. Instead, her lackadaisical confidence appeared to be ever unwavering at the bleak suggestion. “I would not concern yourself over it too harshly, darling. You’ve already found one satisfactory meal, no?”</p>
			<p>“Ah, Monsieur and I were actually planning an expedition of sorts if you would like to join. The fierce manner in which you wield that axe, surely it shall come in handy if any foul beasts await us in the darker depths of this realm.”</p>

			<p>The confidence displayed by Y’vvtal seems to be infectious, as Daphne appeared to regain her enthusiasm. “Heh, you’re right Y’vvy. What am I saying?! No need to be down in the dumps. If there’s a will, there’s a way!”</p>
			<p>“And yes, I’ll join your party. We must get our bearings in order.” The large axe is brought forth upon its mention. “Ah, you’re talking about Hyperion eh? The finest weapon I acquired. Yes, we’ll be safe as long as we have this with us.” She smiles assuredly.</p>

			<p>As the Keeper is about to leave, Daphne furiously charges towards the disfigured man with her massive emerald axe about to strike. “How bout we sacrifice your ugly ass mug instead, you fucking CREEP?!” She brings the weapon down to the stone floor where the ghoul once stood. The sheer forced created a suprisingly large crater, but the Keeper already disappeared. Daphne sighs while shaking her head as pulls her signature axe over her shoulder. “Tch… missed my shot. Trying to kill that bastard got me working an appetite. Now what?” She ponders out loud as she scopes her surroundings.</p>

			<p>Shortly after Atalanta's complaints, Lucifer moves closer to the crater in long, mostly silent strides. Her steps let out quiet metallic rings.</p>
			<p>Lucifer's right arm points down at the indented dissolving mess. A detailed and quickly moving red flash pulses from the cannon appendage for less than half a second, tracing the ruins.</p>
			<p>She turns to face Atalanta. &quot;Are you entirely dissatisfied with being here?&quot; The voice is of a woman, indistinguishable from a regular human. Soft, and deeper than average.</p>

			<p>Taken aback by the robotic mannerisms of Lucifer, Daphne shimmied a bit to allow the inspecting robot to view the damage uninterrupted. “This woman…” whispered the mercenary to herself, “she looks like someone who’d come from Dark City. How gnarly.”</p>
			<p>Upon being asked the question, she nods in affirmation with a slight frown. “Why of course I am! Nobody asked to be here, least of all myself. You seem like the analytical type, Miss… errr, Robot.” Daphne faltered after lacking knowledge of the robotic woman’s name. “Do you have any advice how to get out if this mess?”</p>

			<p>&quot;Miss is accurate.&quot; Lucifer stares for several seconds. For a brief moment her pupils subtly shift as if scanning Atalanta. &quot;...Earnest. Very well. Participation is mandatory. Your boisterous demeanor has a high probability of garnering you allies and enemies alike. Drawing unnecessary attention to your capabilities will embolden would-be enemies to strike sooner or in greater numbers. My advice, avoid immediate confrontations and sow allegiances with those of similar mindsets.&quot;</p>
			<p>Lucifer takes a large step forward, bringing the two awkwardly close. &quot;I am Lucifer.&quot;</p>

			<p>“Yeesh. Talk about blunt.” Daphne exhales after hearing Lucifer’s response. “But I appreciate people who get to the point.  noted. Perhaps throwing my weight around was a bit telling, but honestly its better to illustrate what I’m capable of than to fake being demure and vulnerable. Anyone who dares to make an enemy of me will surely regret it.” She swings her axe around her head like a helicopter with much bravado, finishing off with a pose that’d make an anime protagonist jealous.<br />
			The vibes quickly turned uncomfortable once Lucifer invaded Daphne’s personal space. Clearly flustered, the normally gutsy woman becomes embarrassed with blushing pink cheeks. “N-N-Not so close, please!” She sputtered indignantly. Upon hearing the name, Daphne gives a curious look. “Lucifer huh? Normally that’s a guys name where I come from. Not like it matters much. Atalanta Daphne Cauville is the name. Feel free to refer to me as you see fit. Do… do you mind if I call you Lucy?” She asks cautiously.</p>

			<p>&quot;Lucy is fine.&quot; Lucifer replies quickly and unflinching. She does not retreat and instead continues. &quot;Atalanta Daphne Cauville. Daphne will suffice. It is a name I am fond of.&quot;</p>
			<p>Once more, Lucifer's eyes study Atalanta, though this time much more slowly and involving a clear nod as she scans from head to toe and back again. &quot;Your capabilities are impressive considering your constitution. It leaves me with many questions.&quot; Lucifer finishes her statement with the two's eyes locked.</p>

			<p>The compliment regarding her name is received very well with Daphne, beaming proudly. “Thanks, Lucy! Means a lot coming from you. Though you’re still… a little… eh, never mind.” She decided to leave Lucifer to her own devices as she continues her very close inspection.</p>
			<p>“My… constitution huh.” The woman’s eyebrows twiches a bit once Lucifer comments after her perusal. She doesnt exactly scowl though. Her free left hand rests on her stomach. “Dare I ask what questions these might be?”</p>

Must not be logical how I got my physical abilities when I have a muffin top. Basically, I got enhancers. Not sure if you can perceive them or not, but that’s how I’m strong and speedy as I am. Appearances can be deceiving as they say.” She smirks with a wink.</p>
			<p>“As for your assessment…” Daphne pauses a moment, still a bit flustered from Lucifer’s rather ‘familiar’ mannerisms. “I suppose I trust your judgement given you’re so advanced. If anyone can give a proper analysis, it’s someone with a computer for a brain. N-Not sure if that’s a compliment or not. Just my honest thoughts.”</p>

Put shortly, while I no longer possess a biological brain, you and I are more similar than not in what derives our intelligence. If that answer is insufficient I can explain further.&quot;</p>

			<p>You enter a cold, brightly illuminated room. Lanterns hang from spokes jutting out of each of the oaken support beams running along either side of this vast, high-ceilinged chamber of stone. All around you, racks of arms and armor impose upon you, poking their sharp edges and eyeless faces at your every exposed vulnerability as if by design. Steel covers the floor, the walls, the ceiling. Axes hang from chains affixed up high; spears make arches across aisles and aisles of shelving; and shields and crossed swords occupy those places on the walls which might have been more pleasantly taken by portraits and other fixtures.</p>
			<p>Including the main hall where you stand, the armory consists of five chambers. To your immediate left and right—and then again to the left and right at the opposite end of the room perpendicularly to the exit—tall, doorless arches enter into each their own smaller armories. These four sub-chambers do not appear to be any better organized than the main hall itself; so far as you can tell, each room is made up of the same confused metal.</p>

As she does this, she tilts her head back slightly and draws in a long breath, before exhaling slowly. “This place… is certainly pleasant,” The gnome says. “A lovely fragrance in the air, quite the welcoming atmosphere…” She looks down at her feet and shuffles them a little, though they’re not exactly visible, since she’s buried up to her waist in a puddle of red.</p>

Once she stabilized herself, she returned to gazing up at him, a wide smile on her face.
			&quot;Well, I could say something similar to you. I've never seen an intelligent being quite as large as yourself-- before today at least. Now, I find myself surrounded with them!&quot; She lets out a hearty laugh. &quot;You're also quite shiny. Certainly not fashionable to my eyes, but to each their own, I presume.&quot;</p>
			<p>She laughs once more as Solomos points out her earlier comments. &quot;Sarcasm, my dear. What is there to like about this place, completely absent of even the concept of whimsy?&quot; She looks down once more. &quot;Along with that, I appear to be in a situation of sorts, regarding my foothold. This is unlike any bath I've ever taken, I must say.&quot;</p>

			<p>&quot;Absent of whimsy... I suppose that is one way to phrase it.&quot; You can hear a slight lilt of amusement in his voice. &quot;I suppose my being 'shiny' also lacks whimsy, though I must admit, whimsicality is not a priority I consider heavily for most things.&quot;</p>
			<p>&quot;I must assume that it isn't very comfortable being of your stature in this place. I presume it was not intended much for your peoples. Perhaps intelligent beings of your size are quite uncommon across the many worlds that I believe our hosts gathered us from.&quot; He looks down at her for another moment. &quot;Would you like a hand, Miss...?&quot; He stretches the end of the sentence, likely waiting for her to fill in with her name.</p>

			<p>“Aha, my bad. A gnome.” She corrects herself sheepishly. “I’m Atalanta Daphne Cauville, feel free to just call me Atalanta or Daphne. Where I come from, folks of your kind are allegedly extinct due to the goblin wars. There have been dubious claims of sightings, but never confirmed. Its nothing short of a miracle in my eyes to see a dw- gnome in the flesh.”</p>
			<p>Daphne began to assume a pondering stance. “Do you hail from a realm where only your kind exists, or are there other beings present as well?”</p>

			<p>A quiet sigh escapes Sprinkle when goblins are mentioned, and she nods after Daphne speaks. &quot;I'm Sprinkle Trixiewicket, and yes, my world is quite populated with gnomes, however, goblins and trolls are also abundant. I've never had many troubles with them, though.&quot; She explains. &quot;However, that isn't to say that other gnomes haven't. Goblins and trolls seem to find us quite appetizing. I don't think it'll be them that does us in, though.&quot;</p>

			<p>Appearing sympathetic upon hearing the threat goblins and trolls pose to gnomes, Daphne smiles to brighten the mood. “Well that makes two of us who have those miscreants as our adversaries. My apologies for bringing up unpleasant memories. Nobody is going to make a meal out of you, Ms. Sprixie!” She winks playfully. Then the plump woman snaps her fingers upon remembering something.</p>
			<p>“Are gnomes particularly skilled as blacksmiths?” Daphne asks eagerly with increased intrigue. “Maybe I’m still confusing legends of dwarfs with your reality of gnomes, but I thought I’d ask just in case.”</p>

			<p>Lifting her hand, she pressed a finger to her chin, which stained her skin with red, though she didn't seem to react to it. &quot;I'm certainly not skilled as a blacksmith,&quot; She laughed heartily. &quot;I was a humble mushroom farmer.&quot; She then added, before her smile faltered a bit.</p>
			<p>&quot;Oh... my beautiful, lovingly cared-for farm...&quot; She quietly says, before a sniffle escapes her. &quot;I'm so good at cultivating mushrooms...!&quot; She then cries out, raising her hands to her eyes with an audible sob.</p>

			<p>Daphne appears noticeably disappointed upon hearing the gnome was not a smithy, but recovers back into a more positive disposition. “Ohh! A farmer, are you? Thats what my family does for a living back home. Haven’t been back there since-”</p>
			<p>With Sprinkle crying suddenly and aubidly, Daphne is initially caught off gaurd. However, moved by the gnome’s apparent homesickness, she pities her and offers her a handkerchief to dry her tear swelled eyes. Then out of instinct she gets on her knees and gently hugs the disconsolate Sprinkle. Daphne didn’t seem to mind to mind getting blood on herself in the process. “Chin up, Ms. Sprinkle,” soothes the mercenary kindly, “I’m sure your lovely farm is perfectly fine and that you’ll return there in due time. After we deal with that dreadful ghoul who brought us to this horrible place.”</p>

			<p>Sprinkle doesn't seem to notice the handkerchief at first, but she does, obviously, notice when Daphne hugged her, likely having to lift her right up off the ground to properly do so. &quot;Ua-,&quot; She makes a noise, sounding very shaken by the action. &quot;D-Don't touch me so suddenly!&quot; She exclaims in a slightly panicked-sounding tone.</p>

			<p>Realizing the gnome was a bit vexed by this as opposed to comforted, Daphne looks a bit embarrassed and carefully makes sure Sprinkle is let go and safely on the ground. The mercenary then makes a pensive, apologetic gensture that almost resembles a dogeza. “I-I’m so sorry, Miss Sprinkle. Got a little caught up in the moment. Hope you’re okay.”</p>

			<p>The giant oaken door easily gives way at the slightest push, unlatching with a loud clunk. Behind it, a short flight of stair on both sides leads to the inner courtyard of the castle. Right past it, another set of massive doors.</p>
			<p>A thin blanket of cloud filters the sun’s light, letting through only a yellow-brown, dusty haze. As you hike into the grimy light of day, a series of caved and rusted portcullises and weathered archways guides you through a maze of overgrown battlements and crumbling towers which may very well once have been magnificent. Now, however, the castle is carpeted in dying weeds and brambles, its walls adorned with leafless vines and scraggly moss clumps. Wherever you step, shards of glass and chunks of broken brick stab at you.</p>
			<p>The castle allure is a short climb away on splintered stairs, coiling around the perimeter along its now weathered defenses. The alcoves below once rifling with activity, now stow away the wreckage of what once was the daily life of this broken place. A strong sea breeze lures you to look behind the battlements, where waves shatter against ashen rocks. On the horizon on one side, a twisting forest painted with dark emerald, brown and black. On the other, sea as far as the eye can see.</p>

Mere words can not quite describe the nostalgia that is flowing through me currently.” Y’vvtal brushes a hand through her hair lightly and lets the sea breeze gently kiss her exposed skin. Perched up upon one of the half-obliterated battlements, Mademoiselle looks out to the ocean with a hint of admiring, and to the forest with curious intrigue.</p>
			<p>“The fate of every Kingdom, no? Desolate dynasties. Reclaimed royalty.” Y’vvtal almost sounds wistful, but not quite “It is quite romantique…”</p>

			<p>You scour through the ruins, bits of fallen walls and green overgrow slowing down your search. The little you find has long surrendered to the test of time. Wooden bits have turned to dust, iron pieces are warped with rust and nigh unrecognizable, pots and vases are scattered in pieces.
			A quick analysis brings you to the conclusion that these were some sort of living and trade quarters for more common people than those who lived inside the majestic castle. And while the castle had been maintained, if shoddily, possibly by your now captors, these outsides have been left to rot for dozens, if not hundreds of years.</p>

			<p>“Well z’then, it appears we could have not asked for finer suited allies in this excursion. Good to know, and a pleasure.”</p>
			<p>Nothing of interest left here, Mademoiselle grows restless</p>
			<p>“Shall we continue? The forest is calling me, and I would like to test this supposed barrier that imprisons us here myself. That is, unless you three would rather take a dip in the sea, no?” Teasing, Mademoiselle beckons the others to follow as she attempts to exit the castle through the passage marked <strong>(6)</strong> The Keeper</p>

			<p>You rest your weight against the massive iron-banded gates. With a creaking sound of metal and rust, they slowly split open to reveal an entrance gateway. The door opposite to you is wide open, and a strong draft blows through the fissure you created carrying the pungent smell of resin and undergrowth rot. As you take a step further, you notice the entryway opens into a wider room with a door on each side embedded into the inner wooden structure. Given their location, it’s easy to imagine them leading up to the twin towers guarding this forgotten fortress.</p>
			<p>The wilderness has reclaimed most of the land in front of the bridge, now overgrown with moss and vines. A dirt path continues forward and into the darkness. Only the caws of distant crows dare break the unnatural silence shrouding those dark and twisted woods.</p>

			<p>The Grand Sorcerer carefully descends the wooden stairs which took him up to the wall. He walks past Atalanta, and stands in the gateway. He then steps past the two entrances to the towers which flank the entrance, but doesn't step out onto the main body of the bridge. &quot;And, of course, <em>It</em> will stop us if we go out too deep into that forest, hm.&quot;</p>

			<p>Eventually she does recover and is able to give the Grand Sorcerer a proper answer. “I suppose my axe could <em>in theory</em> work for collecting lumber, but no. That’s not my job. I am but a mercenary. Hyperion is intended for slaying hostile monsters and rogue humans, not wood. That’s why I… mistakenly jumped the gun before.

			<p>Done clearing the various misunderstandings, the group split and each takes one of the doors leading to the towers.</p>
			<p>You enter into a circular space, cramped with crates, barrels and furniture. Unlike the rest of the castle, it is very obvious that the place has seen recent use and has been maintained quite well. A circular staircase spirals upwards following the curve of the outer wall and takes you to the upper level of the tower, where more of the same is on display. The supplies within these rooms are divided by kind. Rich assortments of food both dried and fresh, utensils and tools for repairing and cleaning, suspicious vials of components in a wide spectrum of colors.</p>
			<p>The towers join again through a corridor above the main gate, in which you find the controls of the wooden drawbridge forming the first section of the bridge leading outside. Testing the mechanism proves useless, as it has been corroded by rust long ago. Secured with iron binds to a pillar in the center of each tower, a ladder ascends to an open trapdoor, a square of gray letting in the view of the clouded sky. The flat roof is barren and empty, only dust keeping you company as you contemplate the vastness of your surroundings.</p>

			<p>The Grand Sorcerer glances away as Atalanta laughs, before returning his gaze to her. &quot;Once again, there is no need to apologize for your actions now. A mercenary? I'd not have supposed. Are you... contracted to guard one place? You seem more... healthy than the mercenaries which I have seen now and again. No impoliteness intended.&quot;</p>

			<p>The mercenary shakes her head. “Nah, I’m a freelancer. First come, first serve. I get commissions from all over the country, so my crew and I are frequently on the move.”She gives the masked man a surprised look after his following comment. “Healthy? That’s a first. I’m used to hearing the opposite from the snarky inclined. Don’t worry, Sir Jonlibert. I’m not offended. Quite the contrary, I’m pleased to know someone has good taste!”</p>
			<p>Upon hearing the notion of the foods origin Daphne pauses, having already eaten half of the pie. If the Grand Sorcerer wanted to instill cold feet into her, it succeeded, as she now appears conflicted  and apprehensive. “Urp… well, good point. This pie was pretty gamey and rich anyways. Besides, who knows what that damn bastard put in this anyways.” She discards it and looks over the remaining storage. “Still, it’s good to at least know there’s some sort of nourishment for us. Regardless of how suspicious it is, it’s better than starving. I was concerned we’d be forced to brave the forests in search for meals, or worse… resort to eating rats. Yuck!” Daphne grimaces at the thought.</p>
			<p>“Are you concerned about it being enchanted or poisoned? It would be counterintuitive for the creep for set up this twisted game only for us to die by own hands and be without participants. In fact, I think this food is intended to be eaten, but as a test to see if anyone will fight amongst the themselves over portions.”</p>

			<p>The Grand Sorcerer, seeming unworried, bends down to a table and grabs an apple, and then turns away from Daphne.

			<p>Mademoiselle searches through the food but doesn’t take any as a meal. Thinking ahead she also pockets several glass vials. Upon reaching the roof of the tower she appreciates the brief moment of silence.</p>
			<p>“Well then, it appears no cavalry shall be coming for us anytime soon.” Gazing out to the deep emerald forest, she parses the top canopy looking for any areas where the density of trees might grow shallow, suggesting a housed valley or settlement hidden from within. Looking shall only go so far, however, and thus Mademoiselle grows eager to press on.</p>
			<p>Waving across to the other tower where Daphne and Jonlibert stood, she shouts “<em>Last one to the forest is ze rotten egg!</em>”</p>
			<p>Y’vvtal exchanges a cheeky glance at the armor-clad Solomos, then takes a blind step backwards, falling directly down the square opening from which they climbed up. Presumably, even if Solomos were hasteful enough to catch up, he would only just catch a brief glimpse of the French woman from behind atop the winding staircase, of which she also fearlessly steps off of. By the time any of the 3 can catch up, Y’vvtal is casually strolling across the bridge to meet the forest’s entrance.</p>
			<p>Y’vvtal presses on The Keeper</p>
			<p>She starts her journey into the forest first by confirming if it can even be entered. They pull one of the empty glass vials out of their jean pocket and throw it surprisingly far to test any barrier or force-field that cannot be seen with the naked eye.</p>

One step turns into twenty, minutes into hours into days into minutes again.</p>

			<p>The two of you trace your steps back to the inside halls. The throne room is exactly as you left it in all its gore, devoid of human life as you approach the door on the right. The entrance opens easily, and you are greeted by a much different spectacle.</p>
			<p>Throughout the hall before you, the red glow of multiple dozen tallow candlesticks in iron sconces blends with a ghostly blue air flowing through windows on the far side from you, enveloping this space in a violet atmosphere that flickers and wavers in the rhythm of fire and yet which glides and billows like thick fog. The room is furnished with long-tables and cushioned chairs, wine cabinets and shelves of glassware—all of whom possess ornately carved gothic extremities: statuettes of vines and flowers, robed women and miniature gargoyles carved from oak. In the room’s dancing light, the shadows of all these sculptures sway and bob erratically across every surface in view.</p>
			<p>The tables are set to feed a village, yet sit presently devoid of food. The dual rows of tables are draped in white silk, and each seat thereof has its own pair of glass plates on intricate doilies, its own polished set of silverware, an empty wine glass, and a floral teacup. At the rear of the dining hall, three huge windows in vaulted, cross-patterned iron frames gaze down upon the unseated tables. Hung beside each window, abstract portraits and alien landscape paintings distract from the twisted garden visible beyond this room.</p>

			<p>_ _
			Your attention is immediately caught by an open door in the newly discovered room, through which can be heard cracks of open flame.</p>
			<p>You smell fire and charred wood and animal fat. You hear a drip-drop rhythm of sizzles. Honed to these sensations, you turn a corner and enter a trapezoidal room made up of white bricks marred with dark stains and long-dried oil trails. Pots and pans hang from ropes fastened to the scaffolded ceiling overhead. Huge bowls of doughs and soups cover the floor, the tables, and the corners of the whole space. Bags of sugar, spices, and of dried goods sprawl everywhere, many of them lying on their sides and spilling their contents. In the back corner of the room, a fire rages. Barely contained within a black iron cauldron underneath the room’s chimney, the source of the sound and smell is a bonafide pyre whose flame tongues slather a number of plucked chickens dangling above the pot, burning them. The cookfire which you deduce must have begun with the modest wood pile smoldering underneath the cooking pot has grown into a gluttonous inferno, and it hungers for chicken. The kitchen staff who presumably must exist in order to have started this cook, have left this room unattended, it would seem.</p>
			<p>A more attentive search reveals nothing of particular value, but surely fills your mouth with drool. It's almost dinner time, after all.</p>

			<p>Lucifer replies after listening to Crispin without so much as a stir. &quot;I wear no attire. Our dialogue is not unwelcome and you have not overstepped your boundaries.&quot; Her eyes study the pool of blood for a few seconds before turning to Crispin. &quot;Mortal plane, normal mortals, cursed blood. Elaborate.&quot;</p>

			<p>Crispin is a little somewhat aback by Lucifer's way of speaking.
			&quot;Well, perhaps you are not well versed in scripture. The mortal plane is our world, where physical laws are upheld. Beyond that is the supernatural plane, where metaphysical forces have greater influence. Debates rage on how exactly the two interact, or whether there are more realms beyond, but perhaps it is best if we do not engage in discussion that may be considered ...heretical. As for this blood, why it seems rather odd, does it not? Too viscous, a foul smell, and a faint but sinister aura. It is like nothing I have seen before.&quot;</p>
			<p>&quot;Ah, but my manners! Crispin Brent, renowned monk at your service. You seem a wise figure of high status, I am happy to offer my assistance ᶠᵒʳ ᵃ ˢᵐᵃˡˡ ᶠᵉᵉ if you feel you require any of my services.&quot;
			Crispin closes he eyes and does a quick bow.</p>

			<p>Lucifer is still as a statue while Crispin speaks. As soon as the man rises from his bow, Lucifer replies, still staring down at him. &quot;The blood is odd, as is everything here... I am Lucifer. My status is irrelevant here. While appreciated, your explanations have spawned new questions. Scripture, supernatural, metaphysical, heretical. Would further elaboration constitute as <em>assistance</em>?&quot;</p>

			<p>&quot;L-Lucifer? Surely you must be joking.&quot; Crispin looks agast. &quot;Such a terrible name, I pray you are joking.&quot;
			He shakes his head, regains his composure, and continues:</p>
			<p>&quot;You must have heard, at least, of the divine scriptures, the works of our Lord, the good book? Only though them can we hope to one day rid these lands of the evils that plague them. Until then, It is up to servants of his (like myself) to protect the wealthy and the, uh... not-so-wealthy alike from such demonic forces.&quot;</p>
			<p>&quot;Ah, perhaps you are from the Eastern Lands? I've heard the good word has not reached such places as of yet. Let me offer you a copy of the book, as a symbol of goodwill.&quot;
			Crispin fumbles around in the robe for a second. He frowns.</p>
			<p>&quot;Oh, I must have left it in my... uh... monastery, yes. The monastery I currently live in and operate from, indeed. Nevertheless... once we get out of this, I would be happy to stay at your home for a time and teach you all you care to know... Lucifer. For now though, I propose that perhaps we work together to get out of this mess?&quot;</p>

			<p>Lucifer shows no outward reaction at her name being called outright terrible, but does close the distance between the two by a step after he proposes they work together.</p>
			<p>With a lifted chin, downward gaze, and imposing posture, she says with a voice growing a bit in volume and intensity, &quot;Suppose I was your god and my appearance here was your test. With all other rules of this trial still applying, what would do you do?&quot;</p>

Were they, their inaction would be unforgivable. Cruel at worst, incompetent at best. Neither deserve your respect... I have further inquiries, of your scripture, lord, 'good book', demonic forces, and Eastern Lands. Before that, you gravitate to projections of fear and obscuring of desire.

Variety in the entities present is greater.&quot; Her eyes fall back on Crispin. &quot;I am still processing what this all equates. Currently, I have no reason to be afraid for my existence.&quot;</p>
			<p>She stares at the monk for a few seconds before continuing. &quot;All desires are <em>primitive</em>. Regardless, I have reached an understanding of your trepidation.

			The Giant humanoid figure with a body which almost no light reaches, stands tall over everyone one around her. The crowd of &quot;Guests&quot; feel her pull. Pulling. Pulling. Pulling at everything around her. Her footsteps on needle like legs stab the ground with lethal elegance leaving shattered ground and dynamically metamorphosed rock, each step fighting the planet beneath her. Her mass pulling small fragments of rock into her as if they had forgotten which planet they came from. Flashes of pure blackness appear occasionally at her feet as the force she generates creates centimetre sized black holes which blink out of exitance nearly instantly.</p>
			<p>As the Keeper speaks something changes. The pulling of everything seemingly mimic her speech, waves of gravity as one of her vantablack arms move towards her head as if to ponder. &quot;⟿⤐⟿⟿⤖⤘⤐⟿⤘⤐⤘⤐⤖&quot;
			Her accretion disk changes to a dark purple and the pulling quietens as if she is somehow evolving to meet her surroundings needs. &quot;Victor sum astrorum et RECTOR GALAXIES! Sto tamen in medio ludorum tuorum ..... et nihil possum facere.&quot;(1) Her shout is defanging with amazing power behind it.</p>
			<p>(she ramps up!: <a href="https://youtu.be/i2D3TkBKD_8?t=536">https://youtu.be/i2D3TkBKD_8?t=536</a>)
			As the keeper continues to speak, her accretion disk changes once more to a warm blend of purple and orange. As this happens, the weight of everyone seems to return to normal, their bodies no longer arguing which way is up. No breathing of gravity itself, and no feeling of being pulled towards her.
			&quot;You Take my strength and mass away! Why!? To put me on the same level as these carbon life forms?&quot; She gestures towards the crowd &quot;Just for you cruel games? You will suffer under my weight as I bare down on you! FOR. I. AM. ADHARA!&quot;</p>
			<p>(1):(That is latin: &quot;I Am a conqueror of stars and a RULER OF GALAXIES! Yet I stand the middle of your petty game... And I can do nothing&quot;)</p>

			<p>A boisterous laugh could be heard across the hall. The mercenary could hear the black holes tirades upon being held captive, which must’ve amused her.
			Daphne approaches the being irreverently and boldly. She twirls her massive axes around like a cheerleader would a baton while doing so. “Bwahahahahahahaha! Hehe, you’re a funny one! All that talk of being all tough and yet here you are, no better than us ‘carbon life forms’ whatever that means. Goodness, it’s been a while since I had a good laugh. You’ll make a good jester for us all!”</p>

My stance is irrelevant ultimately, but I nonetheless decided to digress to humor your question.”</p>
			<p>The mercenary sets down the axe behind her while crossing her arms. Her face becomes stern. “Now it’s <em>your</em> turn to answer questions.

Take a lesson from the other high positioned figures who been thrust here alongside us, and exercise some modesty.

			<p>Much of Lucifer's apparent focus is given to Adhara before and immediately after the Keeper dissolves. Despite faring the black hole's disturbances well she keeps her distance.</p>
			<p>A few minutes after the Keeper's dust had both figuratively and literally settled, Lucifer points her cannon arm at Adhara. A bright red flash almost perfectly encapsulates Adhara's frame for a fraction of a second. The arm lowers immediately afterward and Lucifer approaches. Her quiet, lightly clanging steps stop when there's a good twenty feet between them.</p>
			<p>&quot;Do I converse with information inside or outside your horizon?&quot; Lucifer's voice is that of an ordinary human woman. Soft and deeper than average.</p>

			<p>Adhara's body turns to face Lucifer however her head doesn't seem to move. A moment of silence before she speaks &quot;I am able to hear you. You can speak freely outside, inside would mean a swift death.&quot;</p>
			<p>Adhara walks closer to lucifer before crouching down to her height. Her mass no longer pulling at everything. She pauses as if staring at Lucifer. She begins to speak again. &quot;An android.. Interesting. What is your name android?&quot; She extends back to full height and sticks out an arm. Her vantablack arm only defined by the bent light going around it, but it doesn't seem like it will pull Lucifer in or act in any other way than a regular arm. &quot;I am Adhara.&quot;</p>

			<p>Lucifer does not back off, but is visibly wary as Adhara approaches.</p>
			<p>&quot;I am Lucifer. I still do not know if I converse with information inside or outside of your event horizon, Adhara.&quot; Lucifer looks at Adhara's arm. &quot;Your existence is beyond my understanding. What will transpire if we make contact?&quot;</p>

			<p>&quot;Nothing much. Having a body that only destroys what it touches would not be very useful would it?&quot;
			Adhara then walks over to a nearby table and effortlessly picks it up. She then places it down exactly how it was. &quot;You see, I would get nowhere if I couldn't touch anything. How ever my head is another story, that will take in anything that touches it.&quot;</p>
			<p>She then walks back over to Lucifer and once again sticks her hand out. &quot;What would you want from a contract? I can offer most things. You would mearly have to sugest it.&quot;</p>

			<p>&quot;Contract?&quot; Lucifer stares at the extended hand. &quot;The probability you exist as I am led to believe is infinitesimally small.

			<p>Adhara huffs, seemingly pleased at Lucifers insightfulnes. &quot;Well Lucifer, you are certainly insightful. My original proposal would have certianly had no benifits to you. But your knowledge and insightfulness seems to be far higher than I expected. I will have to reconsider my proposal. But for now, for someone so curious as ask about the singularity is a rare occurence.&quot;</p>
			<p>Adhara shoo's Lucifer back before she gives a demonstration. &quot;This is unlikely to work with those people having taken my mass. But never the less we shall press on.&quot; She raises her leg and stabs the ground with such incredible force that a small black hole forms. Adhara picks it up using her own gravity as a sort of cage to pick it up. She then extends her arm out showing him before the black hole quickly vanishes. &quot;As you are aware, black holes evaportate, due to what I belive you call. Hawking radiation? Either way if you know how they work that saves time exaplaining things.&quot;</p>
			<p>&quot;As for the singularity, or ringularity for any real black hole. It contains all of the black holes mass within an infinantly small point. And from what I recall that is the extent of human knowledge of a singularity. What they do not know is that within the singularity information is preserved and can be harvested through the use of negative gravity which can only exist within a balck hole. How ever, this is dangerous work even for us. Only aspects of information can be harvested so even if we fall into the singularity only some thoughts and memories can be brought back. Even we have to be tethered to safely go near it.&quot;</p>
			<p>She sighs. &quot;I know some who have tried to destroy or take our homes singularity and been taken into it. The few thoughts that were recovered showed us a true hell. The stories of punished afterlifes look like a holiday on the beach in comparaison. Be warned Lucifer. We umbrae have spent billions of years understaning the singularity, and even we are affraid.&quot;</p>

			<p>Lucifer does not react in any way, shape, or form during Adhara's explanation. Once finished, though, she replies, her voice a touch higher and the words spoken a tad quicker. &quot;To summarize, Umbrae are sentient entities made of matter and energy that comprise a black hole. The singularity of said black hole is irrelevant to your consciousness, but possesses information you are able to tap into with great risk. Have I understood you correctly?&quot;</p>

										</div>
										<div class='conversation-post-body'>
			<p>&quot;Yes and no. Maybe this will make it clearer. Assume the singularity is a like a library. However to access any of the knowledge you must put your self at great risk. And the singularity I am speaking of is the singularity of my home. The singularity of my head contains my conciousness. The only difference between me and the singularity within our home is the mass. The singularity of my home contains everything. Where as only intelegence and sentience was compressed into my singularity during my creation.&quot;</p>
			<p>&quot;Say if I managed to consume enough mass to become the same size as home I would also likely not be truely sentient. But that is unconfirmed as that is something that could never happen.&quot;</p>

			<p>&quot;Understood. Your existence is interesting and terrifying.&quot; Lucifer slowly stares up and down Adhara's body, examining each bit of her from a safe distance. She comments during, &quot;I am uncertain of constants between universes. The laws that govern your precarious existence may differ from one's I am familiar with. Proposal, we discuss further elsewhere. Privacy may be beneficial to our dialogue.&quot; Before waiting for a reply, Lucifer adds on, &quot;If agreeable, you will decide our location.&quot;</p>

Her vantablack arm only outlined by the bending light around it, but her limbs don't seem to be anything other than vantablack. &quot;I am Adhara.

			<p>A red glow precedes you down a creaking stair, and you find yourself suddenly immersed into someplace dark and wet and slick with grime. You descend another, subsequent stair—this one curved and made of stone—into a candlelit room whose floor is covered in stray pages and wax stalagmites. In spite of all the cave slime, dust plumes beneath you as you reach the stair’s landing, whereupon you find a table and benches so caked with dust-mud that they appear to be made of slate. On the table sit four candles of differing heights—fresh candles, unlike those pooling in the corners of the room and spilling from the stone shelves protruding from every wall. Piles of disintegrating tomes surround you, most of them enveloped by darkness. Brick arches intersect overhead, who catch every mousey noise you make entering this place and bounce the sounds around as echoes flung back toward the hole from whence you arrived.</p>
			<p>The Keeper is standing with his back turned to the entrance, in front of a large table. Cleaner than the others, it hosts a wide rainbow of colors, trapped in as many ampullae and glasses.</p>
			<p>Some unrecognizable brown shape dangles in front of him, propped onto a hook dangling from the ceiling. The man's hand reaches for the tools on his left, picking from a sinister variety of choices and stabbing the blade into the shape with a single, practiced motion.
			_ _</p>

			<p>Sprouts of red fountain downwards to fill an iron coated basin, sitting on the table right in front of the madman. &quot;But not all of them have blood, oh no no no. This won't do. Scraps for the metal ones, a thread for the doll... Gravity, for the broken star. All is ready, oh Wretched One! I have prepared a vessel for your meal, just as you requested!&quot;</p>
			<p>Pulling out a pocket watch, he pauses for a moment. &quot;Almost time... For the celebration! A feast for the arrival of our guests! Shall your servant go and alert them? Ooh, Wretched One, your will be done!&quot;</p>
			<p>Finished rambling, he turns around to face in the direction of the stairs, and of a hidden Frenchwoman he has not yet noticed the presence of.</p>

			<p>Mademoiselle happily struts over to the putrid hanging lump and does a crossed x-slash motion with her arms. Blood splatters, and like a handy parlor trick two pieces of cutlery were suddenly held in each hand with two cuts of the chef’s finest meat. The lady eats the first piece unseasoned, then dips the second inside the soup to test the stock.</p>
			<p>“Mhm~ Z’this is quite dreadful indeed, Garçon. I understand now your humble abode resembles Great Britain in more ways than just aesthetics. Perhaps you should use more gator bile next time-”</p>

			<p>The Keeper breaks into a raucous laughter. &quot;What a rare display! Only a few were as bold as as you, lady. Hurting me will lead you to much worse places though. Save your appetites for later!&quot;</p>
