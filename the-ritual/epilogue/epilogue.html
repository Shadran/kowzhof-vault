<h2>The Ritual - Epilogue</h2>
<p>The Keeper is on his knees, facing the sea as dawn shines on the forest. Alongside him, his hooded followers, shivering in fear. He has failed as well, he has displeased the Wretched One, and now he awaits his punishment. This world's punishment.</p>
<p>When The Ritual fails, the Wretched One awakens. In anger, it wipes the world clean, sucking its energy to the last bit. It may take a day, a year, maybe a thousand. But in the end, not a single soul will be spared and all stars will fade to black.</p>
<p>The sea starts to churn, black dots forming on its surface. The cliff begins corroding, the black sludge eating away at all it touches. One after one, they all fall down to their death and vanish into the darkness.</p>
<p>Only one of the initial nine remains. In another world, Atalanta Daphne Cauville still stands. Confused at first, she begins her walk back to town. At the very last moment, she was saved by an unnamed goddess, talking to her through her piece of the Amulet.</p>
<p>The Wretched One however has followed her to her world. Now her battle is on familiar ground. She must prepare and fight, least her world gets destroyed as well.</p>
<h2>ENDING - THE AWAKENING</h2>
<p><strong>Winner</strong>: Atalanta Daphne Cauville</p>
<p>And everyone else is dead.</p>

<h2>About the game</h2>
<p>Thanks for everyone who played! The game was built with a system of branching paths for its story, depending on players' instructions and ability to follow through with some extra objectives. There were two letters that were assigned based on who had explored the most and was most active during day 1 morning. They contained instructions to obtain four pieces of the amulets, that should have been used on the last day to seal the wretched one away. Here's the possible routes for the game:</p>
<img src='https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1133847097154740305/1133858352254951534/TR_Gamestates.png?ex=681f0e21&is=681dbca1&hm=be853aadcbc8ed3385c77e6dbf075c84a79a8aee301240be29fb0f379a515b97&' style='max-width: 100%'></img>
<p><strong>Kill Objectives</strong>: The ritual sacrifices the players had to offer during the game were possible to miss on day 1 and day 2. That would have however caused the kill count to increase in turn</p>
<h3>Day 1</h3>
<p>During day 1, the cast got to know each other. In particular, Y'vvtal and Jonlibert who at first acted friendly towards each other, suddenly lost their mutual trust after receiving the two letters. Y'vvtal refused to share it with the other sorcerer, and this caused a rivalry that snowballed into Solomos, Lucifer and Jonlibert teaming up to kill Y'vvtal. In the meantime, the french magus had recruited Daphne to kill Jonlibert and fend off other attackers. Adhara was instead hellbent on eliminating &quot;the smalls&quot;, Sprinkle and Millie. She had paired with Crispin and hunted Sprinkle during the night.</p>
<h3>Day 2</h3>
<p>With Y'vvtal dead, Jonlibert and Lucifer apologized to Daphne. The three plus Solomos teamed up to complete the objectives from the letters. Adhara however revealed her colors to a few of the characters, and her willingness to destroy the universe.
A big plan was sprung to eliminate the common threat, and two groups were sent to the two rooms to kill her. Crispin's backstab was essential to allow Daphne, with Solomos in tow, to end the living black hole. Daphne however also attacked Crispin for a very personal gripe, creating some anger that would bubble over to day 3.</p>
<h3>Day 3</h3>
<p>With only the final day ahead of them, the people in the know about The Sealing planned to complete the final objective and end the Wretched One. But Solomos was of a different mind. He stroke a secret deal with the Keeper that would've spared his world for a billion years if he had ended the others from completing the objective.
His plans however were miscalculated. In trying to provide the kills necessary for the ritual, he got dealt massive damage by first Crispin and then Sprinkle, ending his plan prematurely.</p>

<p>The game ended with everyone sinking into the ground and vanishing, presumably consumed by the Wretched One. Daphne however was deemed worthy by the goddess who had created the Amulet, and saved at the last second by being teleported back to her world.</p>
