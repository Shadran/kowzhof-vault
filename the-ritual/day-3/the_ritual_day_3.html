			<p>You awake from your slumber.</p>
			<p>This time, it's not the ringing of a bell to wake you up, but the clamor of people. Sounds of furniture being moved, cutlery being laid out, fires roaring and rushed steps to and from the castle echo in those usually silent courtyards.</p>
			<p>Several hooded people, two dozens or maybe more, are intent in preparing the dining hall. Lit torches hang on the walls, bottles of wine and casks of ale have been placed around and a beautiful smell of roasted meats comes from the kitchen. It would be a pretty festive sight if it wasn't for all those black-shrouded figures working in unison, not a single word being exchanged between them.</p>
			<p>As you approach the hall attracted by all the ruckus, you get met by the usual voice of The Keeper. This time he is not standing atop the steps leading to the throne, but right in the middle of the hall.</p>
			<p>&quot;With a banquet! This is how we start this glorious final day in <strong>its</strong> celebration! The Ritual proceeds, one more has been sacrificed, and now we approach the end of our ceremony!&quot; As he pauses, all the hooded cultists within earshot turn towards him and bow their head. The room gets awfully quiet for a couple seconds, before everyone returns to their previous task.</p>
			<p>&quot;Feast, you all!&quot; he then continues, motioning with his arms at the lot of you. &quot;Feast so that your soul and body may be filled, so that the last two sacrifices of tonight may bask in his abhorrent glory!&quot;</p>
			<p>Done with his speech, he returns to directing the preparations for the banquet. He hits and prods and berates the poor figures every time something is not to his liking, and you get the feeling that whatever food is being prepared won't start coming out until midday.</p>
			<p>The Ritual is almost over.</p>

			<p>========</p>
			<p>Tonight, you must sacrifice <strong>Two</strong> people.</p>

			<p>The Grand Sorcerer once again re-enters the main room. &quot;It would seem that, for all her talk of an order, if there is one then Adhara was at the bottom of it last night. One might think her to be more aware.&quot; He runs his hand over his skull mask.</p>
			<p>&quot;So then, which of you 5 will be the final 2 pieces, the lowest of the remaining order? Or do you reject  the idea of such an order?&quot;</p>

			<p>Crispin limps into the room, his clothing torn, his eyes half-closed.
			&quot;I see now, how you all conspire against me!&quot;
			He steadies his breathing and leans back against a wall for support.
			&quot;So quick to fall for the allure of a false idol.&quot; He murmers, &quot;Enjoy your stay here, because you won't be going anywhere better when it's over.&quot;</p>

			&quot;It's just like we discussed, my dear. Ones like us... seen as nothing but lambs to the slaughter. Sent out to kill and be killed. Rest assured, your compatriots will turn on you, in time, as they have turned on me.&quot;</p>

			<p>Sprinkle stares up at him for a short while. &quot;Was that not true from the very beginning?! You need to look at reality! We've been trapped here and forced to fight! Although we stand at a relatively steady alliance for the most part at the moment, if that was to continue, we wouldn't fulfill the request of our captor!&quot;</p>

			<p>“Well well well, look what the cat dragged in!” chirps Daphne with a smirk as she struts over to the critically injured monk. Upon further expecting the man she seems to momentarily grimace at his sorry state, but soon resumes her spiteful sneer. “Whoops! My hand slipped! Truth is… I don’t exactly like your face, so I thought I’d give it a makeover! Looks like I overdid it. <em>Sooooorrrrrrry!</em>” The mercenary jeers without a hint of remorse.</p>
			<p>“Also…” Her tone becoming noticeably more stern and loud, “You don’t have <em>any</em> fucking right to lecture anyone here, much less <strong>me</strong>, about idols when you not only worship one yourself, but exhibited greedy and suspicious behavior from the start… that’d more than likely upset your so-called god!” Daphne takes some deep breaths and regains a bit of composure.</p>

			<p>Crispin shrinks back a little at Atalanta's insults, but when he opens his mouth, his tone is defient.
			&quot;I'm amazed you even have the gall to insult my face, when the deceitful bile spewing from your mouth is so caustic, I must remind myself I am not gazing into the lake of sulphur itself! Just the site of you makes me desire to throw myself onto the Keepers blade, for it would be a slightly more expedient way of avoiding your presence than leaving the room. When you finished off Adhara for me, was it your sword that accomplished the task? Or was it simply her realisation that she would be stuck hanging around with <em>you</em> for the night!? You ha-&quot;</p>
			<p>Suddenly, he bends over and coughs up some blood, bringing his stream of insults to an end. After recovering and straightening himself back up, he whispers:
			&quot;Kill me if you dare, but the fires of hell will only burn hotter for you when you arrive.&quot;</p>

			<p>Daphne scoffs while rolling her eyes. “Yeah yeah, Mr. Fire-and-Brimstone. I get it. I did a ‘no-no’ and hurt a <em>trustworthy, selfless, pious</em> disciple of a nonexistent sky man. Ugh, you religious people are fucking <strong>INSUFFERABLE!</strong> At least Kyle Fairbarn wasnt this preachy and holier than thou. I’d sure love to fan whatever dirty laundry your hairless head has been covering up.”</p>
			<p>“But hey,” she smirks as she gives a small shrug, “Truth is, I didn’t want to <em>kill</em> you. Just let my frustrations out of my system. So I’ll leave your sorry ass alone. Not like you’ll survive for much longer with wounds like that anyways. Unless… you want me to put you out of your misery. Maybe this deity of yours actually exists and you can be reunited in the clouds, though it sure would be awkward to ask why he forsaken you.” She gives an amused snort.</p>

			<p>With Hyperion in one hand and a large cake in another, the plucky mercenary strolls down the hall while taking bites out of her treat. Icing covers her face like shaving cream. Eventually a lone rug she comes across makes a decent sitting space and she takes a seat. “Mmmmmmm,” she murmurs while savoring her sweets, “I still hate your guts, Keeper. You ugly sack of shit. But damn, you make a damn fine cake. Nom nom…” She continues munching away.</p>

			<p>The gnome walks up to the mercenary, reaching a hand up to briefly rub at her eyes for a second, blinking multiple times up at the woman, her eyes still a strange white color. “... It seems you’re in a situation.” She points out. “Some people seem upset at you.” She notes, while her gaze seems to move down to the cake in her hand, and remains there.</p>

			<p>“Some people? More like one guy. I can handle a salty chump.” She shrugs while continuing to eat. Noticing the gnome eying the cake, she breaks off small pieces into a free hand. She then lowers it to Sprinkle’s level. It appears to be an offering.</p>

			<p>Seeing the injured Solomos, Sprinkle runs over at what seems to be full speed, but she is not very fast. “You’re hurt!” She cries out. “Is this from Adhara?! How dare she…! I’m so sorry Solomos…! This is my fault…!” The gnome begins to sob, throwing herself at the large man’s leg and wrapping her arms around it, wailing in despair.</p>

			<p>Sprinkle, though appearing unharmed, hobbles forwards for a short distance before stopping. Entirely white, cloudy eyes observe the others standing around her for a short while. Then, with a sudden groaning noise, she reaches up and touches her hand against her hat. From the top of her hat, a thin white growth has appeared, uneven in shape, and covered in the same strange fuzz that is present on the rest of her body.</p>
			<p>She remains in this position for a few moments, before she takes a deep breath and slowly stands up straight. “... She’s gone, it appears.” She says. “I wished to help, but it appears I’d gone to the wrong location. To all of you, I offer my thanks and my apologies. I’m glad you are all still with us.”</p>
			<p>She looks down to the ground, blinking several times, before a smile spreads across her face. “Wherever Adhara is, I hope that, although it would be a much too late realization, that she realizes the ‘natural order’ she was such a purveyor of does not care for status. None are immune. Even the most powerful of beings can be killed by the most miniscule.”</p>

			<p>Swift footsteps could be heard down the hall and reaching closer to the gnome. They belonged to Daphne who rushed over to her with a beaming look. “There you are, Ms. Sprinkle! It’s good to see you safe and sound! The Empress will not harass you anymore. And you got <em>me</em> to thank! Here’s to being alive!”</p>
			<p>She gets onto her knees and extends an open hand forward a handful of inches away from the tiny woman. It seems like she was preparing a high-five, albeit one in place as to not inadvertently injure Sprinkle.</p>

			<p>Crispin takes a deep breath, shuts his eyes, and smiles.
			&quot;Perhaps, I should have no ill-conceived notion of returning home once this is all over. I see how some of you view me as a wolf views an injured sheep. Do as you will, but I will remind you that I am by no means defenseless.&quot;</p>
			<p>Indeed, it seems as if many of Crispin's bruises and cuts have converted to miscolored patches of skin and faint scars on his body, leaving the damage to his clothing as the only significant reminder of last night's events.</p>
			<p>&quot;Should I be sent back from this place, I will certainly have a lot to think about. Such an... interesting group of people you all are. Certainly, this is more interesting than my usual duties.&quot;</p>

			<p>&quot;Against me, you <em>are</em> defenseless,&quot; the Grand Sorcerer comments. &quot;Fortunately for you, I have no interestes in killing you, at least not now. What are your... 'usual duties'?&quot;</p>

			<h2>The Banquet</h2>
			<p>After much shuffling of plates and tables, all preparations seem to be done. The Dining Hall shines with the light of a hundred candle flames, glowing bright atop golden chandeliers. Lanterns hang on the walls, providing a comforting orange glow.</p>
			<p>As the sun starts to set and disappear behind the walls of the castle, the servants of the Wretched One bring out a multitude of trays with enough food to feed a legion.</p>
			<p>Massive bowls are placed at the ends of tables, filled with a rainbow assortment of juicy fruits both familiar and unknown. Violet grapes drape off the sides, resting atop big spiraling shapes with a yellow texture akin to lemon zest. Big red berries, almost transparent and watery, peek from behind strange apples with a patchwork of bright colors on their skin.</p>
			<p>Fish is brought out next, served on sharp skewers with an incredible assortment of roasted seafood. Species you cannot recognize, both big and small, lined up in a mouth-watering spectacle. Not only fish but crustaceans with three or four claws, jelly-like assortments of tentacles, shrimps as big as a fist, and more.</p>
			<p>Lastly, the meat. With great ceremony, four attendants bring forth a massive tray. On top of it, ribs of an unspecified beast, grilled and browned to perfection. As long as an arm, they look like a single one of them could feed you for a day.</p>
			<p>Casks of ale and wine immediately follow. They get uncorked, and the contents start flowing freely, with bowls immediately placed under to catch the pouring liquid. As the liquids fall inside, they vanish, and the flow never stops. It seems you can serve yourself by just bringing a cup to these never-ending streams.</p>
			<p>&quot;My dear guests! The Wretched One provides!&quot; When all the food has been brought, the Keeper advances with ceremony. &quot;Here is a banquet, to nourish your bodies and your spirits alike! It is content with your actions, and us humble servants have prepared this meal for you! Let us all eat and drink in its name!&quot;</p>

			<p>The Grand Sorcerer stands before the tables covered in food. He looks down at it all. &quot;The Wretched One provides, you say... tell me, did you and your fellow servants fish up this food yourself? Pick these fruits from orchards? Or did that <em>thing</em> conjure this food.&quot;</p>

			<p>&quot;The Wretched One works through its servants in this case.&quot; The Keeper shows Jonlibert a wide grin &quot;The fruit was bought from a great market in Numer, and transported here yesterday. The fish was fished on this very coast in a village to the east. The meat, this ravenboar was hunted at the edge of this forest. Vicious creature, but its meat is the most prized in all of Arkanda!&quot;</p>

			<p>&quot;Oh good, I feared it actually came <em>from</em> that <em>thing</em>,&quot; he says, before sitting down and taking off his gloves, his long legs awkwardly stretching out beneath the table. He hunches inwards to prevent revealing his face, as with one hand he lifts his mask, and with another he reaches for the ribs, and starts eating. After swallowing, he asks: &quot;Do you and the other followers leave the castle often?&quot;</p>

			<p>&quot;We only tread these ground once every hundred of years. When <strong>The Ritual</strong> demands it. After it's concluded, many of the others return to their lives. Others, like me, bring <strong>its</strong> worship elsewhere, to find more people willing to join the fold.&quot;</p>

			<p>Crispin can't help but look at the food. At first he tries to ignore it, but eventually he can't resist, and goes over to sneak a bite out of one of the fruits. Upon tasting the item, his eyes light up, and he begins to attempt to steathily move various foodstuffs from the table into his robe, all while trying not to catch the attention of the keeper or the other contestants. He even covertly dips his hand into one of the wine flows when he is sure no-one is looking.</p>

			<p>&quot;The curtain falls on the final day,&quot; the Grand Sorcerer proclaims. &quot;I believe I have made my decisions. Let us honor those who have fallen and those who will now fall tonight.&quot; He stands up with a wineglass from the table. &quot;So it shall go.&quot; He throws the glass down, shattering it.</p>
