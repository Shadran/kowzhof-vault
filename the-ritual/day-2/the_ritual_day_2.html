<p>Pale light timidly filters from beyond the castle walls, choked by dark clouds threatening rain.</p>
<p>It is morning.</p>
<p>The rhythmical clamor of a bell calls for everyone to gather, and as you rise from your torpor and move towards the sound you notice the Throne Room doors are wide open and a hooded figure is already standing behind the bloodied throne.</p>
<p>After you are all gathered, the Keeper steps in the open. Much like the previous day, he raises a hand to prepare for an announcement, resting the other on the slimy chunks of organic matter surrounding him. The hall quietens.</p>
<p>“Servants of the Wretched One! You have done well! That hungry, curious lady is now feasting in his turpid halls and the doll as well! The Ritual proceeds as planned. Although it’s unfortunate that one of the sacrifices willingly decided to unravel themselves and deprived you all of the pleasure of becoming executioners for a second time, I am more than sure that you will make up for it soon.” A wicked laugh echoes through the hall, the hunchback clearly satisfied with the events that transpired during the night.</p>
<p>“We are now entering the second day of this Ritual. All is ready for you to prove once more your desire to serve <strong>it</strong>! Since you have done well, today you will have again to sacrifice just <strong>one</strong> person. Who will it be? Who will it be?!”</p>
<p>Taking a few excited steps, the man descends from his vantage point and passes by you all. His introduction done, he stares with bulging eyes as he takes his leave. This time there is no flashy disappearance: he opens the door to his right and vanishes down a corridor, presumably to his usual spot in the Warden’s Room.</p>
<p>The Ritual continues.
_ _</p>

<p>Tonight, you must sacrifice <strong>One</strong> person.</p>

<p>A somewhat beat up looking gnome stood slouched and motionless for a few seconds once relative silence had returned to the throne room, before a slight convulsion rippled through her form, and she stood up straight once more. “My, last night brought some unexpected occurrences…” She notes. “I can’t say I could-could-co-co-c-could have foreseen that…”
Her gaze turns down onto herself, before her twitching hands reach up and press against her tall, green hat, which was seemingly slightly paler than it had been the day before, a fuzzy white coating covering its surface. “Oh… All of this is truly bad for my head…” She groans. “I need… something to-t-to eat, somewhere to rest…”</p>

<p>She looks up to the Grand Sorcerer, and she takes a moment to stare at him before she speaks. &quot;I was a-attacked by Adhara.&quot; She states plainly, matching how straightforward he was. &quot;Unjustly, I'd say.&quot; She then added on.</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm.&quot; He states. &quot;She is very tall... you are very small... I wonder if it was fated to be. Still, you seem to have survived. Maybe you are not as dangerous as I thought.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That there are those who are inherently above or below others? Hm. For one in my position it is impossible to deny that there are those with and without magical talent, not everyone is born equal. Still, there are ways to change one's position despite this. I suppose in that regard then I am not a... 'proprietor' of a natural order, nor have I interest in enforcing it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You seem to have had quite the trying night.&quot; Solomos approaches and crouches in front of the gnome, extending a hand. &quot;I'm sure we can find you the dining hall and get you some rest.

<p>The gnome looks up at Solomos, and her already seemingly closed eyes appear to squint for a second. &quot;That would be lovely, indeed...&quot; She says, extending her own hand and grasping one of Solomos' fingers with it. &quot;I would enjoy going somewhere a little quieter.&quot;</p>

<p>Crispin looks around at all the figures in the room. He seems a tad more accustomed to his surroundings then yesterday. Once he has taken note of everyone, he frowns.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, that French girl, I see she did not make it. Truly, I wished to speak to her again. She will be in my prayers.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No doll either? Perhaps they finished each other off. I find it difficult to believe the rest of us would be so... murderously inclined.&quot;</p>

<p>Lucifer approaches Crispin and stops about five feet from the man. Her immediate question is asked in much the same manner as her previous dealings with Crispin. A woman's voice, indistinguishable from any ordinary human, with a pitch a bit lower than average, but not by much. Similarly, a stiffness to her language remains. &quot;You have endured. What transpired?&quot;</p>

<p>Crispin beams warmly.
&quot;Oh, why I had a pleasent sleep in this manor's quarters. The beds here are surprisingly nice, you know? Though I must admit, the scurrying of rats through the place did provide me with some restless hours.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I see you have... <em>endured</em> at well. Not that I expected any less, of course.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Scurrying rats being the predominant woe bodes well for your survival. You evaded temptations. On point, perhaps.&quot; Lucifer shifts her gaze toward the exit. &quot;Suggestion, we resume yesterday's inquiries of your scripture, lord, 'good book', demonic forces, and Eastern Lands in the gardens. The scenery may assist in your recollection and telling. The decision is yours.&quot; The metallic woman seems keen on following Crispin wherever he goes, whether it be public, private, inside, or outside.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I suppose a walk outside would do us both well. Though I am enjoying not having to sleep outside like I usually do... uh, for training.&quot;</p>
<p>Crispin and Lucifer head out to <strong>The Garden</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Ah, viewed from the outside, the place looks far grander, it's rotten interior shielded from view by a stoic and noble exterior. Rather poetic, considering the unclaimed nature of last nights killings. Wouldn't you say, Lucifer?&quot;
He stands still and silent for a moment.</p>
<p>&quot;Apologies, nature gets me in a rather philosophical mood. If you like, I suppose I can answer any biblical questions you may have. Questions about the true nature of demonic forces can only be answered speculatively, I'm afraid. Certainly the occurance of our present situation makes me re-evaluate any theories I had.&quot;</p>

<p>Lucifer stares at Crispin when posed the question, adding awkwardness to the brief silence.</p>
<p>&quot;Apologies aren't warranted. I agree with your sentiments.&quot; She, too, goes silent for a moment as she scans the garden. &quot;Dilapidation. Mere ruin in different states. Ours, visceral and immediate. Theirs,&quot; she gestures with her hand the garden as a whole, &quot;unknown, yet a conclusion mirroring the deceased in this trial all the same.&quot;</p>
<p>Turning to face Crispin, Lucifer continues, &quot;Meaning can be derived in any substance. Its weight is neither great nor minuscule... I repeat, inquiry of your scripture, lord, 'good book', demonic forces, Eastern Lands,&quot; she moves a step closer to Crispin, staring down at the man almost uncomfortably close, &quot;and <em>Lucifer</em>. I have learned my name holds meaning in many universes. Y'vvtal cannot answer my questions so now I turn to you for that, too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Lucifer, I believe the word originally meant &quot;light-bringer&quot; or &quot;morning star&quot;, though in what language, I could not tell you. Perhaps it's true origins are lost to time, or perhaps someone older than I could tell you. In any case, it's more commonly used as a name for... The Devil.&quot;</p>
<p>Crispin stares Lucifer right in the eyes. All of a sudden, his expression changes to be rigid and serious.</p>
<p>&quot;The Devil is an <em>evil</em> being who tricks and deceives men to commit vile, sinful acts. It is he who tempts them to stray from the path of righteousness, and opens them up to misfortune and misery! Could you even <em>begin</em> to conceive of such an treacherous creature?&quot;</p>
<p>As he talks, he gestures wildly for effect, causing the dust and leaves around him to shake. Clearly, he's performed this particular speech before.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes! And he drags the souls of the damned down into his domain, punishing them for all eternity with his army of demons, who grow more powerful as they feast on the wicked!&quot;</p>
<p>He looks at Lucifer to gauge his reaction.</p>

<p>Lucifer is still as a statue, as she normally is, watching with her typical unblinking eyes as Crispin does his spiel.</p>
<p>&quot;...Understood. I coincidentally share a name with an infamous religious figure in your, and other, universes. Elaborate, does <em>Lucifer</em> play a significant role in your scripture, lord, 'good book', demonic forces, and Eastern Lands? Further explanation of 'Lucifer' is desired, too.&quot; Nothing seems different about Lucifer as she keeps up the questioning.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Lucifer is certainly present in the scriptures. It is written that he tempts Jesus in the desert, and that he tempts Job away from God. He is even thrown out of Heaven to attempting to personally overthrow God. All very scary stuff, I assure you.&quot;</p>
<p>Crispin is a little dissapointed in Lucifer's lack of emotional response to his speech.
&quot;Tell me, how did you obtain such a name anyway? Perhaps it has some meaning in... well, wherever you are from.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You gave yourself the name Lucifer?&quot; Crispin seems intrigued, and a little intimidated. &quot;I see. How peculiar, to come up with such a name on a whim...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Lucifer was a perfect, beautiful being, one of the greatest angels in heaven. However, in his brilliance he became so prideful, so envious of God's power and his connection to mankind, that he attempted to overthrow him in a grand coup. Of course, he failed, and so he and the angels who followed him were cast down into hell. Some believe that those angels became the original demons that haunt the world to this day.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The scriptures do not go into much detail regarding the coup itself, but I can only imagine it was <em>extremely</em> short lived. A valuable reminder, I find, for anyone who begins to see themself as a little too high and mighty. Not that I am accusing you of having any such traits, of course.&quot;</p>

<p>As the thin man speaks, the gnome’s head turns to face him. Her small face quickly becomes red with a visible anger, and she marches directly over to him, her finger pointing up at him. “You!” She shouts. “You were helping her!”</p>

<p>Crispin raises his hands defensively in front of himself. He is clearly shocked by the gnome's attitude.
&quot;I encounter a vicious horde of vermin in front of me during a calming nighttime walk, and I am expected to simply stand idle? Such vile creatures are to be forcefully expelled! They will absolutely tear through bedding, you know. Not to mention the droppings.&quot;</p>

<p>The gnome has a slight convulsion in her small body as the man speaks, before she visibly calms down. &quot;... I suppose I mustn't be upset with you if you did not harm me.&quot; She states. &quot;I was merely... deflecting my anger at her unto you, so I must apologize.&quot;
She bows slightly, before craning her neck upwards to look at him again. &quot;Though, I wouldn't refer to them as vermin. They're creatures, the same as you and I. We're not that different. Though they may inconvenience us at times, it is the fault of the one who was inconvenienced, is it not? The beast is simply doing as it knows to do, it is not a malicious action. If you wish to not be inconvenienced, you must take preventative measures to keep them from the space you've declared as your own.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wise words, wise indeed.&quot;
Crispin thinks, somewhat calmer now.
&quot;I am, indeed, too quick to assign malice to such simple mechanisms of nature. One cannot accuse creation itself of being sinful, after all. Perhaps I have let my rashness grow unchecked under the effects of such a place as this.&quot;</p>

<p>Daphne trudges along looking bruised and lightly bandaged. Her face, normally feisty and cheerful, is noticeably more somber. Rubbing her eyes, she looks around several times. After several minutes, this stops and the mercenary lets out a resigned sigh.</p>
<p>“That… wasn’t a bad dream after all.” She murmurs to herself, “Guess I might be exploring this castle, but without a captain.”</p>

<p>As she walks up to Atlanta her height quickly shows and she stands towering over Atlanta. &quot;The loss of a captain is only a set back. How do you fare Atlanta?&quot;</p>
<p>She slavic squats to be equal in height to Atlanta, Her accretion disk eye level and almost too bright to look at. &quot;You seem worse for ware, I would hope you will remain standing if you still wish to accept my offer.&quot; If Adhara had a face it would surely be staring Atlanta so hard it would make anyone sweat.</p>

Much appreciated.” She gives Sprinkle a thumbs up. “Hopefully we both make it out of this okay!”</p>

<p>The door to this room is polished hazel banded in vine-patterned silver, with an overarch of engraved brick which depicts a regal castle standing center in a flowery wood. You open the door to a dome-shaped room illuminated in gold. A floor of irregular wooden floor tiles polished to the point of sheening invites you under a ribbed half-sphere ceiling painted orange. In the center of the room, a bed draped in fine velvet sits upon a wooden frame whose every limb and extremity is rounded smooth and lacquered, affixed to a perfect circle backboard of exotic composition. The thick, dark-oak ring around the bed’s backboard contrasts sharply with the room’s white-flagstone walls and the sprawl of abstract paintings framed in hazel hung upon them. At the left side of the room from the bed, a pile of pillows sit on a tasseled red rug beside an unlit hearth inset to the wall. At the other side, three circle windows in flamboyant crossed frames let a warm glow through parted gold drapes. Sunlight catches in a lanternless chandelier hanging from the ceiling where it is redistributed through a funnel-shaped pane of glass all throughout the room.</p>

With some study one would notice a few nearly imperceptible scratches on her left shoulder and some deviation, perhaps even disorder, to her short hair.</p>
<p>With the Keeper's departure, Lucifer quickly scans the room. Her one hand lightly brushes some of her hair to the side.</p>

<p>Adhara walks over to Lucifer before giving a single chuckle. &quot;I see that you are alive Lucifer. And in better condition than most. Now, would you like to resume our previous discussions?&quot;
Shen then pulls Lucifer to the dining hall where she effortlessly picks up a table and two chairs which are sized to Lucifer and Adhara. She then sits down making her self cofortable. The back of the chair breaking apart slightly and flying into her event horizon.</p>

<p>Lucifer says nothing in return to Adhara's greeting, but follows her to the dining hall without complaint.</p>
<p>Eying the chair placed in front of her, Lucifer comments, &quot;Its integrity is insufficient... A new chair will be required every three to four minutes.&quot; Her voice is just as it was yesterday; indistinguishable from an ordinary human with a slightly lower pitch than average. As Lucifer sits the immediate creak of splintering wood is heard. The chair endures for now.</p>
<p>Staring right at Adhara's event horizon head, she answers the question from earlier, &quot;Your accommodations are appreciated. Continuing from yesterday is ideal... I cannot ascertain your condition. How did you fare last night?&quot;</p>

<p>Adhara laughs. &quot;Looks like we'll both need new chairs in due time!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But for now I fare very well. What of you? You appear in a similar condition to me. Although my encounter with the gnome did little to affect me......... Now Lucifer, ask away. What do you wish to know?&quot;</p>

<p>Adhara has to think for a minute after Lucifer finished with her list of questions. &quot;Shall I answer them in order? Might be best&quot;
&quot;The fundamental forces do play a part but only in our birth.&quot;
&quot;And yes more of us will arise. And as I said, they play a part in our birth. We are a self creating species.&quot;
&quot;And our existence is the result of creating a black hole out of a planet with intelligent life on it, then feeding it mass to survive. Even we, after all these billions of years don't know how or what happens at the point of conversion but the working theory is that every individual on the planet becomes one entity. We create more of each other. Those who are born naturally are of a higher class, I am not one sadly which makes my mission harder. &quot;
&quot;We can be interplanar but working is 3 dimensions is simpler and most tend to not work in the 4th and 5th.&quot;
Adhara pauses for a moment intentionally ignoring one of her questions.
&quot;We possess the same emotions as human societies.&quot;</p>
<p>She then pauses for longer, considering how to word what she is going to say next.
&quot;I recall most of my 6 billion years, except the things I was forced to forget. Unlike humans I do not have a limit to how much memory I can contain.&quot; She pauses. &quot;We have aspirations. And our almost infinite life spans means we grow egotistical and ruthless. For most their aspirations are to live and rule forever, making an ever larger clan of Umbrae. However my aspirations differ.&quot;</p>
<p>Another pause, considering. Then continues. &quot;If you are aware of the concept of false vacuum decay...... I wish for that. To end the egotistical Umbrae and my self. And while I search for that goal I will prevent more of us spawning. I crush planets to galaxies to prevent more of us.&quot;</p>

<p>Lucifer seems to react ever so slightly at the explanation of how the Umbrae come to be with a momentary widening of the eyes, but is otherwise still.</p>
<p>&quot;...We have briefly discussed false vacuum decay. My stance is unchanged. Your primary objective is understandable.&quot; As she finishes her sentence a loud crack is followed by a similarly loud thud as Lucifer's chair breaks and she falls bottom first onto the floor. Without any hint of embarrassment or annoyance she stands up and continues. &quot;Umbrae remain fascinating and terrifying. Some of my inquiries were misunderstood. Clarification, did more fundamental interactions exist independent of Umbrae during the earlier stages of your universe? Will more arise? What catalyst was responsible for spontaneous existence of your universe?&quot; She continues to stare at Adhara after reiterating some of her questions.</p>

<p>She chuckles at the broken chair, fully aware hers will shortly follow suit. &quot;The big bang was our catalyst. Likely similar to yours. And much like the human planet. Even we do not know what the catalyst truly was, or what was before it. We may be able to function in higher planes but even we have limits. And I do not intently focus on knowledge as much as my sisters and brothers I do not know whether their are interactions independent of us. That would be a question for them should you chose to take my offer at the end of your life.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I hope I have cleared some of my misunderstandings&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I lie only slightly when I say do not pursue knowledge. I pursue knowledge on false vacuum decay. Which is when the delicate balance between quantum particles breaks down, the. What humans call the Higgs field, would break out of its false vacuum in a domino effect throughout the universe called vacuum decay. This would unravel everything in the universe. Including black holes, myself and the egotistical Umbrae.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And as for progress I am nearing completion. Maybe in one or two milenia in human time scales. And as I gather further knowledge the more the key to my goal is the singularly its self. But those of colossal black holes. This will unravel everything and every dimension. But do not fret. It will take place long after you are gone. Assuming you have the same life span as normal humans.&quot;</p>

<p>The giant black hole struts into the room. Before standing still, listening intently to their host speak. As he continues to go on everything around her seems to be pulled towards her. As if everything is tensing, preparing for something.</p>
<p>Once he stops speaking everything returns to normal. As normal can be in their situations. She then gives a sigh. &quot;So, she is dead. She gives me a warning yet does not listen to the one I gave her.&quot;</p>
<p>She stabs the ground in a fit of rage, a quick flash of darkness as tiny black hole vanishes from existence. The tiny crater surrounded by metamorphosed rock. Before she scoffs. &quot;Maybe her own cheese killed her. Eating that poison.&quot; She then stands there and ponders.</p>

<p>The black hole’s presence is quite hard to miss, and so Sprinkle takes a moment to simply stare at her before she puffs out her small chest, holds her arms, with fists balled at the ends, out slightly at her sides, and approaches the massive being. “Hey!” She calls upwards. “What you did last night was quite uncalled for!”
Her fists then firmly thump against and remain upon her hips, her annoyance on clear display. “I don’t recall us speaking at any moment prior to then, nor do I recall doing anything to anger you. You need to learn some manners!”</p>

<p>The black whole who looks like a sky scraper compared to the gnome looks down the crouches down and leans In close. Her event horizon and accretion disk taking up her entire field of view. And exerting a serious pull onto Sprinkle, but not enough to cause any damage.  &quot;Manners?! HA! Little, little gnome. What I have done is necessary. We all have our place in the universe and you are at the bottom. Your are only alive for the benefit of others! Even I am not at the top of the chain but I am leagues above you.&quot;</p>
<p>She then stands up looking down at the tiny gnome. &quot;What manners can you teach to someone who rules galaxies?&quot;</p>

<p>The gnome backs away as Adhara leans closer, raising her hands up to her face and turning her head away slightly as the bright light overtakes her vision. Her eyes fully clench shut, and she begins gritting her teeth. &quot;P-Please move back, the light is quite painful...!&quot; She requests in a tone of desperation.
Only when Adhara returns to a standing position does she hesitantly remove her hands from her face again. &quot;Although gnomes may not be the largest or most powerful beings, we are all creatures, are we not?&quot; She says, her voice calming once more. &quot;Does my status as a relatively lesser being offend you so greatly that you see the need to eliminate me entirely?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You understand nothing of the order!&quot; The gnome shouts, once again covering her eyes as Adhara leans closer. &quot;The order is not something that must be purposefully enforced!

<p>The Grand Sorcerer enters the main room and looks around. &quot;Miss LaRue-Alarie was no match for the enemies she made. What a shame she bit off more of her baguette than she could chew.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Still, as a fellow practicer of the magic arts, I will not mock her failings. Let us raise a toast in her honor.-&quot; he seems to have taken a bottle of wine down from the tower where the foodstuffs were.</p>
<p>&quot;Let us hope that becoming a sacrifice to that monster does not doom her to suffering within it... but if it does...&quot; he uncorks the bottle of wine and walks over to the enormous pool of blood. &quot;May she have the first drink.&quot; He pours a small amount into the blood.</p>
