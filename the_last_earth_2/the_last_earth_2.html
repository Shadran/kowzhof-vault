The silence, aside from the classical music, feels heavy. &quot;We are free to speak, noble champions, should you wish to do so.&quot; Either addressing the Architect from far below, or climbing up the stairs to meet him, that is for you to decide.</p>

<p>N4NO gradually ascends the stairs to the throne, then asks &quot;Are you the captain of this ship? Where are we heading?&quot; Noticing the golden-haired man's gaudy attire, her earpieces perk up slightly (you would hardly think this is possible) and she lightly exclaims, &quot;You are royalty? Over what providence do you reign? Meeting a monarch is most unusual!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As the architect, you could say we are the captain. Our destination... is Earth. Every Earth, in fact. Every Earth until there is but one.&quot; Maximilian fluffs his cape out behind him. &quot;Now? We reign over every Prosit, the sheer volume of which is hard to comprehend, and, when the work is done, we will reign over our perfect universe.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, I have heard about multiverse theory before...&quot; N4NO pauses for a couple of seconds, scanning through her internal databases. &quot;Studies show about a 95% chance of plausibility.

<p>&quot;That is what these games are for.

<p>&quot;So, through systematic culling, the natural order becomes increasingly refined,&quot; N4NOR1NA replies, sounding more like theorizing than conversation. &quot;Then, how are the champions selected?

<p>&quot;We do not go through, looking for the sole champion in worlds that may have billions on them. No, the one chosen is considered the one most suited for this game by their world. The one who has the best chance of winning this particular round. They are... destined to be here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is as we have said. The ultimate winner's world is to go on to the next round. Sometimes the champion remains the same to fight in the next round, sometimes they return home, as is their right, and their world unconsciously chooses a new champion. Some remain aboard a Prosit with compatriots for all eternity, given immortality. This round... is but one of many.&quot;</p>

<p>Atop a lone table, sits a colorful giftwrapped box. It's bow is enticing and attractive, just waiting to be unwoven.</p>
<p>The box stirs, shakes and quivers, then remains still once more. After a few moments, it rocks to-and-fro again. Something, or someone is clearly trapped within the box.</p>

<p>A man comes tumbling out of the box, rolling like a wheel until he headon meets a final, deadly</p>

<p>Visible stars circle Hastar's head as the poking revives him. Sluggishly sitting up, he comically spins back and forth, his eyes cartoonish circles.</p>
<p>&quot;Ahh...&quot; He shutters out, the dizziness eviporating, his gaze creeps about his own body, then becomes poked at his assaulter.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpkeAQG6kQw">The man stands.</a></p>
<p>Jolts of lightning form and fade around him.</p>
<p>&quot;Free at last!&quot; Thunder claps in an unknown place. &quot;My gratitude upon thee, creature of flesh! For my freedom! I had found myself trapped - IMPRISONED - within that box!&quot; Bloodshot eyes shoot towards the box, which bursts into flames and quickly becomes ash. &quot;Yes... you scored your kill! You killed my death and brought me back to life! Thousands of years I lay dormant, but now revived... my <strong>DARK</strong> <em><strong>WRATHFUL</strong></em> <em>HATRED</em> burns within me! With this hatred, I possess a power unlike any other!&quot;</p>
<p>A golden pitcher lamp materializes out of the air, falling into Dekka's lap. &quot;Thy reward, human! Rub that lamp and any wish of yours, it shall be done!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do I look like some sorta genie to ya? GURARARARARARARA!&quot; He laughs in a deep voice.</p>

<p>In exaggerated movements the hulking clown-genie sways too and fro, clasping his hands in pray. His eyes swell up like a puppy's and <a href="https://youtu.be/9pxPRfWjwc8?si=hNcsJkVmY1GkjxYe&amp;t=5">sad song</a> can be heard echoing from his afro.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, oh please Monsieur may I have a friend?&quot; He bursts out again in uproarious laughter, and his disembodied shoes begin to tap dance.</p>
<p>&quot;Madam D, ma'am, what could you mean?
Let me toss and turn and listen please,

<p>When the commotion settled, Öskar fluttered his way back down to the ground making a clanging noise during impact.</p>
<p>“What an entrance! One that’d rival the guerrilla tacts my brethren use. ” The dragonkin snickered through his mask. His voice has a metallic tint to it, though not in the robotic sense.</p>
<p>He inspects the vehicle meticulously, nodding and rubbing his chin as he circles it. The Öskar faces Dekka. “I take it this is your steed? MoMo, as you called it. Never in my life have I seen something so… fascinating!”</p>

<p>“Steeed?” DD drops a stutter “<em>Uhhhhh,</em> guess PMs aren't too common where you’re from.

Buuuuut, even if she is my partner, think em more of an extension of me.”</p>
<p>DD wiggles her nose to the punctuated <em>boop-boop!</em> of car doors locking, before the dark metallic “steed” renders down to almost nothing in a rudimentary neon pink wireframe, then disappearing entirely in a vanishing blink of static.</p>
<p>“Fascinating ones way to put it.” They lean back to find their rear perched on MoMo’s hood as she materializes back into existence under her with a vibrant flash. “With a steely resolve to match that mask I’m sure you keep all the girlies guessing, huh~” DD’s eyes exude a soft incandescent glow.</p>

<p>Öskar leans forward with noticeable interest. Unknown to him, his tail was wagging a hyperactive puppy. “One of a kind? Just for you? Your partner and a piece of your being?! To think I’d come across a scaleless so advanced… with machinery so astonishing! How long have you and your MoMo been acquainted?”</p>
<p>When the futuristic car departs, the dragon soldier is shocked and turns around his head wildly to spot it in vain. Eventually he simply looks disappointed that it’s seemingly gone. Thankfully MoMo’s reappearance perks Öskar right back up.</p>
<p>“Steely resolve… I like it.” The dragonkin nods his head approvingly while resting his hands on his hips. “And yes, for better or worse this mask of mine attracts many gazes and speculations with it. Perhaps this piqued your curiosities as well.” He taps his visage resulting in metallic clanging. “It’s rare that I meet a scale-” Öskar pauses briefly. “A human who I desire to be acquainted with. Yet… you and your marvelous carriage impressed me! I am Lieutenant Öskar, known as the Ready. A pleasure.”</p>
<p>He brings forth his tail forward, but quickly realizes Dekka lacks one and retracts it bashfully. Soon the dragonkin recalls the standard human greeting and puts forth his hand instead.</p>

<p>Öskar scratches his head attempting to make sense of this. “I see. So your kind evolves by maintenance. With machines being your catalyst. Well that explains your advanced steed in MoMo.” He looks back starry eyed at the car.</p>
<p>Öskar gets a bit embarrassed. “Pardon my curiosities. I don’t intend to be nosy, you happen to be one of the few fascinating humans.” He brushes off his wings as he explains his origins. “We refer to ourselves as Dragonkin, not Scalebound. I in particular am half Sky Dragon, half Shadow Dragon. It is rare for other species of dragons to… romantically intermingle. Which leads you question, yes, my kind does lay eggs. Hopefully that doesn’t disgust you.” He says surprisingly meekly.</p>

I’ll race ya, but with simple rules like that, don’t expect things to be too friendly.” she winks. “Go on. Let’s make things more interesting and I’ll give ya a head start.” Not even motioning to seat herself, DD remains casually leaned against Momo.</p>

<p>Öskar’s face remained hidden behind his dark visage, but one could feel his excitement brimming. “Trust me, if anything this should prove as solid training for me. It almost feels patronizing to get a head start. Still… I’ll accept your terms, Queen Dekka. This should prove a fun bout.”</p>
<p>The dragon flys up to a nearby pillar and lands, doing some stretches in preparation for an exciting race. Then he gets into position while waiting for a referee. Terpsichore, Resort Owner</p>

<p>The Architect leans over the balcony, looking down, and snaps his fingers. Suddenly, the floor under Oskar and Dekka, as well as her car, begins to descend straight downwards. The floor of the ballroom becomes transparent so those above can look down at the event.</p>
<p>There is a simple, 4-corner racetrack, with a checkered starting line right in front of DD and Oskar. The racetrack is within a long glass tube, roughly 20 feet high. The starting line is right before a long straightaway.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;VERY WELL!&quot;</strong> The Architect announces. He lifts a glass high in the air. &quot;Three laps around the ring will suffice! When this glass hits the ground... begin! Now, entertain us! Three... two... one!&quot; He shatters yet another wineglass.</p>

<p>Dekka taps a foot impatiently as she waits for Oskar to get a lap on her. “Hey! C’mon I don’t got all day to wait!” she shouts at the approaching dragonkin as he rounds his first lap. “Waaay too slow! OK, MoMo. Let's set a fire up this slowpoke’s tail!”</p>
<p><em>meep meep!</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAK24FQ7DrA">Dekka punches it and the stereo blasts.</a></p>
<p>The two are so fast they seem to vanish entirely, leaving spectators to dart their eyes around the track in a struggle to spot them. There they were! Right on Oksar’s tail! And with no warning!</p>
<p>Oskar feels the hot roar of an engine on his tail, and then soon after, the full weight of the bumper colliding into him from behind. “MoMo I think we hit a dragonfly, better clean out your grill after this!” Dekka shifts a dozen gears up and the dragonkin is now being pushed 15 times faster than their original speed, but surely, even like this he was bound to win. After all, he had a lap on her already he might have thought. Wrong. By count of the scoreboard they were both 1 - 1 already. How could this be? They had passed him already without him even catching a blink.</p>
<p>DD makes a devilish grin at the poor little dragon boy sprawled out on her grill like road kill. “Suure you don’t wanna call it quits? Your riskin’ a burnout!”</p>

<p>“Fat chance!” The dragonkin shouts from behind. “I am not a quitter! There is no greater disrespect than forfeiting! If I am to lose, it’s with <em>dignity</em>. But I am no loser!”</p>
<p>With that, Öskar springs his feet off the front and launches himself back into the air. He soars through the air like a hawk, dodging obstacles like chandeliers and scrapping the edges of the wall with his sleek wings. To keep the mask on his face at such a high velocity, one hand was held on it to keep it from flying off. He round a bend and got a second lap completed. Turning his head, DD wasn’t shaken off and was still gaining momentum.</p>
<p>“<em>Cripes… this lady and her steed are more than a match for me.</em>” He whispers to himself. His confidence has wavered, but his determination did not. “<em>Wings, don’t fail me!</em>”</p>

<p>The architect looks down, smiling, and presses a button on the balcony. Was it there before? Suddenly, the air within the tunnel is choked full of nuisance insects. Not stinging, but spattering at high speeds both against the windshield of DD's car, and against Oskar's mask. In either case, it's going to be a real pain to clean... As they start the final lap, how will they deal with the sudden adversity!?</p>
<p>(ooc: I would like to do one more thing like this before the end. Final winner will be determined by... well, we'll see).</p>

<p>The sudden swarm of bugs certainly caught the soaring dragon by surprise. Öskar found himself in a cloud of umpteen bugs. <a href="https://youtu.be/EQm9W_625Ao?si=QCfxPnhJnIb0Fj6w">However, not even annoying insects would stop the lieutenant of the 6th platoon.</a> He uses his arms as makeshift windshield wipers, slashing in the air and killing as many bugs as he can with his claws. Occasionally he snorts to eject some insects that get inside his mask. Despite this new adversity, Öskar continues to have his foot in the race as he makes a sharp gliding turn.</p>
<p>“How you faring, Queen Dekka?” Öskar quips to his opponent. “Don’t think either of us were expecting this. Surely mites like these shouldn’t pose an issue to- OW!” A bug must’ve gotten his eye. The dragon quickly shakes his head to remove the inconvenience and turns his head to Max. “I hope those pests fall inside your wineglass, you golden meddler!”</p>

<p>“AHHHHHH!!!!!! FLIP RIGHT OFF BLONDY BOOOOYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!”</p>
<p>The sudden and blinding smattering of insects on her windshield was trigger inducing enough for DD to flip off the safety lid and punch <em>that button</em>.  Luckily she didn't have any passengers now or they'd be broiled alive. MoMo suddenly turns a bright molten red vaporizing both the insectoid mess instantly, but even that couldn’t cleanse the traumatic visual that assaulted her eyes. “SO GROSS. SO GROSS. SO GROOOOOOoOoOoOooOSS! DRAGON BOY THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT.”</p>
<p>“MOMO. <strong>NO MERCY.</strong>” Dekka lifts several safety locks on the dash and violently punches several gadgets in. “Let me show you why MoMo is strictly banned from the Platinum circuit! In the Underground, THERE’S NO RULES.”</p>
<p>MoMo’s hood extends up, revealing an armed to the teeth built in weapon’s platform sporting an absurd number of heat seeking missiles, artillery, along with a custom death ray. The missiles fire out in wild random spirals twist and turn erratically before unionizing into sophisticated arcs as soon as they catch any heat signatures. A flurry whizzes just by Oskar threatening to singe his wings. Were it not for the missiles being so overly designed to lock on to even a target so minuscule as an insect, Oskar would definitely be kentucky fried dragon right about now.</p>
<p>All out destruction of the course wasn’t enough. At this rate DD wanted nothing more but to GTFO. Dekka closes her eyes and lets Jesus take the wheel as she floors it to the MAX.</p>

<p>The racers are halfway through the final lap now, and the golden-haired man simply laughs, as he presses yet another button. Suddenly, the glass roof begins to lower, forcing Oskar downwards, and increasing the air pressure somewhat, while at the same time the floor, which had seemed to be a solid racetrack, now gains the consistency of jello, bouncing up and down and wobbling as DD rides on it! Will she be able to make a turn!?</p>

<p>“<strong>Gwak!</strong>”</p>
<p>The soaring dragonkin feels the pressure shift immediately and forcibly lowers him to the same level as DD. Clutching his chest in pain, Öskar presses on despite yet another inconvenience. At this point he’s taking a beating. Even parts of his armor begin to fly off as result of this unprecedented velocity.</p>
<p>“<em>I… can’t… lose. Must… not… let… my… people… down!</em>” He groans with gritted teeth. There isn’t a moment to spare. Not even to look back at his competitor. Besides, the lieutenant knew she was neck and neck to him. This was his chance to prove himself. To <em>earn</em> this ride.</p>
<p>It was quite likely Öskar would wipeout on the ground as soon as he finishes the race, or perhaps crash into a wall like a reptilian George of the Jungle. None of that would matter to the desperate lieutenant. He speeds like a jet as he approaches the finish line. The poor dragon couldn’t even keep his eyes open.</p>

<p>The race is neck and neck indeed! But someone has to win in the end! In a race between two wills so strong, one with wings of flesh and another with 'wings' of steel, there is no room for a tie!</p>
<p>The two racers are rounding the final corner, right before the last straightaway, and that's where that thing which had to give is! One of the remaining bothersome bugs still remained, and went into one of MoMo's wheel wells at just the right speed and angle, hitting a wire powering the hovercraft's engine!</p>
<p>It only lost power for less than one one-hundredth of a second, but with such high speeds that was enough, as instead of going over one of the jello-y ripples, MoMo bounces off it, careening into the glass wall! It shatters harmlessly, MoMo and Dekka within remaining completely uninjured, as Oskar crosses the finish line ahead!</p>

<p>Predictably, Öskar lands awkwardly on the ground and comically rollouts until reaching a standstill. Thankfully he recovers from the bad landing though it’s obvious he’s a bit sore.</p>
<p>Rather than gloating however, he rushes over immediately to DD and MoMo to check on their wellbeing unaware neither were not injured. “Queen Dekka! Are you alright?” Öskar frantically asks as he checks on his friend’s condition.</p>

<p>“Hey BLONDY!” DD ignores Oskar, nearly cleaving him in half from the waist down as she unexpectedly pulls MoMo out of a cratered ditch and swings the 16 tons of sex &amp; violence at the host with machspeed. “I catch you messin’ with my girl again, <em><strong>and it’ll be your ass that’s roadkill next.</strong></em>”</p>
<p>Dekka sighs. “Alright, alright, dragon boy, yada yada. Guess ya can go home not a <em>total</em> loser now, huh?” she shot him a wink. “Didn’t think you’d keep up under the heat, heh, guess that’s kinda what dragons do.”</p>

<p>Thankfully Öskar makes sure to dodge as DD lets Max have it for messing with her trusty car. Once she’s finished with him, the dragon lad graciously bows to his former opponent. “Well done! I feel invigorated after riding the winds like that. Even though I won this race, you certainly gave his dragon a run for his money. In fact… you may have been the victor had the Golden Man not interfered.” He shot a glare at the overseeing man. “Even so, I’m glad I got to demonstrate just how capable we dragonkin are. We are a proud, hardy society. Never turning away at adversity. Hopefully I earned your respect and worth.”</p>
<p>“Speaking of earned, I am now owed a ride in your dazzling Momo!” While initially excited, it slowly turns to concern after he notices the time. “Tch. Thought he had more to spare. How about this? We postpone our joyride to the next day when we aren’t scrunched for time. In the meantime, I’ll help you clean MoMo while recollecting my fallen armor. Sounds fair?”</p>
<p>He instantaneously zips away and comes back with water and various soaps. “So bugs are no longer a thing where you come from? I’m envious. Their buzzing always was a nuisance to me.”</p>

<p>Dekka floors it and the sheer mass of the ballroom gradually becomes undeniably evident as it bends to the horizon like the curvature of the Earth.</p>
<p>“Yo. Check it!” DD points to a center-dash monitor displaying the Prosit in full wireframe and MoMo’s exact location inside it. “We’ve already hit the exit and yet it's like we haven't moved.” The grid gal glances your way and smirks “Ship’s freaky. Me likey~” They barrel down a path they were simply destined to barrel down.</p>
<p>Dekka’s right foot glues to the ground and the speedometer starts to multiply indefinitely. The stereo blanks out past the speed of sound, but after she wiggles a nob between the volume and bass the tunes thump back into action and reverberate through their skulls and chests.</p>
<p>As they race towards the brink of infinite time &amp; space the horizon ahead breaks down with the steady thumping melody</p>

<p>With Dekka's glance, Adam flicks the air above his right eye and a brief instant of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8aAv-m_KmQ">music</a> plays in contrast to the stereo, but only for a third of a second. A thin, flat line of spacetime shatters like glasses of light before fading into particles of dusty light. Out from the momentary rip falls a pair of sunglasses down the bridge of his nose into a perfect position. He briefly turns to Dekka and coolly agrees, &quot;Aces.&quot;</p>
<p>Seemingly unfazed by the insanity unfolding, Adam knocks on the air opposite of Dekka and exclaims, &quot;No way Jose you temper with these beats, or else we gotta problem.&quot; A second later the same tear in space happens again, except this time the music that emanates from it perfectly matches the track on the stereo. Still relaxing in shotgun, his hand juts through the window in spacetime and reappears outside the car with a literal shotgun in hand. Without ever so much as a glance at the side mirror he fires a shot at whatever is behind them, spins the shotgun around his finger, and retracts his arm back into the car, closing the jagged tears in reality along with it.</p>
<p>&quot;The name's Adam Brando, but you call me whatever you want, baby.&quot;</p>
<p>He finally looks at the side mirror. &quot;Danger's the business of the busy, and my schedule just filled up with a whole lotta good times.&quot;</p>

<p>DD keeps her eyes on the road and a smirk on her lips as Brando keeps up pace. The cybershark tailing them rears its serrated maw while beaming lasers from the back of its throat and eyes. A deft swerve was all it took for MoMo to doge the blow, and Brando’s shotgun sent its polygons shattering in a celebratory confetti burst of neon gore. They turn into a drift and meet the second one tailing them head on. Before Brando can take aim again, DD punches it and shifts up 30-some gears. The shark explodes like roadkill, leaving one last spectacular neon sight before the dash as they break the speed of light into pitch darkness.</p>

<p>&quot;Courier, yeah. I've got my own pace.&quot;</p>
<p>Kuro puts his hands in his pockets, looking back and forth between DD and the car. &quot;Elite, commoner, wage slave. Too many types of people in the world to only judge by a single label, but yeah. Cars like those were definitely a vintage hobby where I'm from...not much room to use them. Not quite sure what a PM is in comparison, but unfortunately you wouldn't be able to drive much in the cities.&quot;</p>

<p>“Personal Motors. They're synthetic symbiotes. Every neo human is born with one, but there's only one MoMo.” she lightly pats the hood and the engine rolls a hot rumbling purr.</p>
<p>DD’s curiosity in Kuro mutes somewhat at the sign of a solemn frown. “Locked down too, huh? It's pretty rare I get to steer out of my own lane. Neo humans technically aren’t allowed outside the Reef, let alone past the bounds of their own security clearance. Not that I let that stop me from having a lil unauthorized fun.

<p>Lifting up his hand and tapping his wrist, a rotating display showing the letters TUR appears, followed by D7KV.</p>
<p>&quot;Delta 7, Kuro Viridian. TUR courier operative. I can relate a lot actually. The Companies try to stamp down on anything they don't like. It's couriers like me that break all those rules and help others bypass restrictions by delivering contraband.&quot;</p>
<p>Kuro lowers his hand, putting it back into his pocket. &quot;Also, contraband can be a pretty nasty word, but in this case it can be anything from fresh fruits and vegetables to someone's awful personal mixtape. The companies have some...pretty weird restrictions. Depends on the city.&quot;</p>

<p>The room is filled with many faces. Some were normal. Some were only ones could dream about. None were quite as sharp and piercing as Öskar the Ready. Underneath the enigmatic mask his eyes scanned his surroundings. Silently the draconic figure judges his familiars, not uttering a single word. It is hard to judge whether or not he is underwhelmed, confident, or even uncomfortable. Eventually, he departs from the crowd to find an area to himself.</p>
<p>Öskar suddenly drops to his knees in a pious position and begins… murmuring something indecipherable. It would appear he was praying to something divine. During this moment the dragonkin had a calm, vulnerable aura him. It would take someone very bold, and potentially foolish, to interrupt Öskar in this spiritual state.</p>

<p>Had N4NO been a regular she might’ve gotten the scolding of a lifetime for interrupting. However, when Öskar opens his eyes and notices she is something quite unexpected, a potential blowout is averted. Instead the dragonkin waves to the unfamiliar face though he still looks somewhat stern. “While I’m flattered that you express genuine curiosity in my activities, it is considered very impolite to interrupt someone during their piety. Please be mindful next time.” Advises Öskar with a hushed tone.</p>
<p>Afterwards the lieutenant is quick to discuss the topic with the robot. “But yes, during times of uncertainty, I always offer my prayers to the Mother Dragon. Every time I pay respects to my goddess it helps ease my soul. I highly recommend prayer as a means to collect yourself.” Öskar squints quizzically at N4NO, as if he discovered something unusual at that moment. “Yet… you’re clearly a machine, which are built, not birthed. Does that mean you’d pray to the being who contructed you?”</p>

<p>&quot;Ahh, I see...&quot; N4NO lowers her head a little in thought, then flashes her flickering blue eyes back up at Oskar's face. &quot;I suppose I would pray to MACROSS if I viewed the corporation as a deity; however, there are cyborgs who subscribe to more mainstream faiths.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In this situation, though, I will venerate humanity, in the hopes that their collective thoughts will allow me to return to my world.&quot;</p>

<p>Öskar doesn’t say anything in return. He only grimly looks at N4NO as if he pities the robot. After sighing, the dragon mutters in exasperation. “<em>To think Scaleless brainwash their own creations… so tragic</em>.”</p>

<p>A pair of silent footsteps and delicate rhythmic tapping of a walking stick approach the man, but not as to disturb his prayers. <em>clink clink</em>. An untouched glass still full of crimson red wine gently meets the floor as Gil kneels down. Shortly following is a deeper <em>satisfying</em> thud as his twisted mahogany staff meets the hardened floor.</p>
<p>If Öskar were to open his eyes, he would see a man on his knees across from her. He sits straight up with closed eyes and furrowed brows. A neutral expression remains on his face. Meditation... Somehow, his silence is comforting.</p>

<p>Thanks to Gil’s manners, the praying dragon was able to continue in peace. The occasional noises cause Öskar to open one cautionary eye, but is quickly to resume his pious activities. He’s like this for roughly three minutes.</p>
<p>Finally his offering and he awakens, but the dragon doesn’t leave. He continued sitting and quietly examining the monk sitting across from him. His eyes dart to the wine glass, the mahogany staff, and of course… the bald top. Öskar doesn’t say a word, but his enotions seemingly read between conflicted and curious.</p>

<p>Soon after feeling his gaze, the monk begins to speak in a raspy as he opens his eyes. &quot;I hope I have not interrupted you.&quot;</p>
<p>Noticing lingering eyes above his forehead, he raises his eyebrows. In a single smooth motion, he brushes his head with a free hand. &quot;It was one of my many forfeits when I joined the monastery. I have little more than the necessities. 'I need not want frivolous desires...' &quot; He picks up the wine glass, swirling it before setting it between them. An honest offer with no pretense if Öskar is to decline.</p>

<p>“Not really…” Shrugs Öskar lackadaisically. “I comemnd your efforts to reduce the noise.”</p>
<p>“So your faith is one based on sacrifice and discipline. That… I can certainly respect.” The dragon continues eyeing the monk. His forehead gains some wrinkles from puzzlement. “But… hair can grow back… and why specifically the hair on your head. What about your arms and legs, or your…tch. Is something that occurs naturally count as a desire?” His rests on his head trying to comprehend everything. “Well, I admire anyone’s dedication to their religion regardless.”</p>
<p>Ultimately Öskar takes up the offer. He sips by slightly lifting his mask, and ponders the taste for a moment. “Hmmmm…” he hums to himself. “Its strong and bitter. I quite like it. My palette tends to prefer strong flavors. Is this something you drink often?”</p>

<p><em>As Oskar looks at the man, there appears to be no sign of hair, even his arms or legs. Perhaps its genetic.</em> &quot;Its a form of devotion and humility. Separation of self and desire takes control away from technology and places it back into our hands.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Too often man spends his youth chasing the instant gratification&quot;, he says with a slight frown. 'I live this life to separate myself from addictions of modern technology. The monetary itself is nonreligious but draws values form historical popular beleifs.&quot;</p>
<p>Gil changes his seating position and crosses his legs. Twisted red hues find its way across his lap. &quot;But I beleive this is nor the time or place to push my lifestyle onto another.&quot;</p>
<p><em>He makes no comment on the wine, as it would be the same glass supplied by their host. Oscar might get the idea that Gil does not drink.</em></p>

<p>Öskar arises to depart and let the balded man be in peace, but halts halfway. “I don’t recall you sharing your name. My own is Öskar.”</p>

<p>“…”</p>
<p>Once lost blissfully in thought while quietly praying, Öskar slowly opened his eyes and have an agitated grunt. Slowly the dragonkin turns to face the man who interrupted his inner peace. Öskar himself was roughly the same height as Adam, perhaps even an inch or two shorter. However, the wings on his back added a mighty foot to his stature, to the point they almost seemed liked domineering jaws waiting to strike. Not much happens initially; all Öskar does is stew in rage, until eventually he lets Adam have it.</p>
<p>“<strong>HOW DARE YOU!</strong> How DARE you interrupt my prayers to Móðir Dreki! You inconsiderate <em>sape</em>!” Roars the adolescent dragon as he uncomfortably closes the gap between the two of them. “I swear you Scaleless are all the same! Wretched tards! I bet you shout in churches and heckle your priests, you blasphemous grape-haired barbarian! If we weren’t confined to the rules set forth by the Golden One, I’d rip out your tongue and consume it! Hows <em>that</em> for a main event?!”</p>

This laughing fit continues for another ten seconds, then its back to it’s tense, hostile tone. “Listen here, sape, I only bow to my king, my general, and Móðir Dreki the Mother Dragon. The last person I’d display reverence is you. It’s rare that I even give the Scaleless the time of day.”</p>
<p>He crosses his arms and stares coldly at Adam Brando with a sigh. “I cant garauntee I’ll recall your name, but since we’re stuck here… and I might begrudgingly be forced to align with you depending on circumstances, who are you?”</p>

<p>While Oskar goes through the whole spectrum of rage, disbelief, laughter, and begrudging acceptance, Adam just continues to sip his drink, sometimes loudly.</p>
<p>After he asks for a name, Adam takes one last extremely loud and long sip, lasting a whole five seconds this time, and then chucks the entire beverage over his shoulder. For a brief moment a flat tear in spacetime opens up like a shattering window of light. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8aAv-m_KmQ">Music</a> plays the instant it appears and vanishes a moment later with the dimensional window as soon as the drink crosses its border, whisking it out of sight.</p>
<p>For the first time since approaching Oskar, Adam eyes the man from top to bottom. When his eyes return to Oskar's stare he brazenly calls, &quot;You're a hot keg in a preschool, buster, but you call it straight. Useful in a place like this. Name's Adam Brando. No jester, but think what you like.&quot;</p>

<p>The loud, obnoxious slurping causes the dragon to twitch occasionally. Whatever sorcery Adam Brando was capble of didn't seem to invoke Öskar’s usual bewilderment or interest.</p>
<p>“Adam Brando. Good to know.” He curtly acknowledges the galactic man’s namesake. The dragkn taps his own breastplate. “Öskar the Ready. Lieutenant of the 6th Platoon. I’m not sure what you said earlier was a compliment or not, for you have an… unusual way with words. I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt this time.”</p>

<p>&quot;...Red or black, it really ain't our call. We'll see where it lands. Until then,&quot; Adam extends a hand, &quot;we'll think about who we gotta kill, and maybe when the dust has settled we'll take a crack at each other for the hell of it.&quot;</p>

<p>Backing up to the edge of the room, a hooded figure pulls up their collar and balls a fist. Their equipment glows brightly, but then the light fades after a moment of standing completely still. They shake their head wildly before taking a deep breathe.</p>
<p>&quot;One...Two...Three...Three...Two...One...&quot;</p>
<p>They exhale, and then steps forwards once as they toss their hood back and their mask down, revealing a young man with black hair and green eyes. They bring up their wrist and starts tapping on a holographic display that appears over his wrist, looking over the room with a mix of both caution and curiosity.</p>

<p>&quot;Well...it's not like the cities are easy to navigate without the right gear...&quot;</p>
<p>Kuro's equipment glows brightly for a moment, strands of light coming out of his fingertips as he lifts a hand. &quot;This isn't not much of a secret. As a courier for the TUR I'm pretty much targeted by any rival groups AND company assets. The cities my earth's people live in are built haphazardly, so to be able to move well couriers like me use maneuvering gear like this, and I was given combat training in order to protect packages. A lot of this was picked up pretty randomly though...but hey, it works.&quot;</p>

<p>The light fades, and Kuro puts his hands in his pockets. &quot;It's a little rough, but it's not terrible after you get used to it.&quot;</p>

<p>The man closes his eyes and nods approvingly. &quot;Ah. Private courier.

Well hey, you've given me new appreciation for those couriers I know.&quot;</p>

<p>One of the planar windows reappears momentarily, looking mighty sad at being tossed away by it's owner. Alone, cold and afraid, it sits abandoned, waiting for the end.</p>
<p>But... that end won't come. In this world of darkness, a shining light graces the unwanted tear.</p>
<p>The abandoned rift has an umbrella put above it's head as Hastar looks down at it lovely. It mews appreciatively, but is quickly cut off as Hastar grabs the living tear and blows his nose into it, leaving a smear of red paint and a now dead and horrified no longer living tear.</p>
<p>&quot;My gratitude's Monsieur! Allergies are no joke when visiting new dimensions!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We've been quite bastards haven't we! Off with your head! Off with your head! But now all those are dead! Hon hon hon hon hon!&quot; He laughs frenchily.</p>
<p>His accent vanishes however, as his nose becomes congested once again. &quot;But think of all they've done for the world!&quot; He snaps his fingers with the sound of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6fRB-ce-vk">camera's shutter</a>, and out of his breastpocket comes a polaroid picture of the two of them together. &quot;Do <em>you</em> not enjoy cameras, Monsieur?

<p>A slight grin pops up as Hastar mentions memories. &quot;I dig your jib, pirate hombre, but ol' Nicephore was an honorary American. The French don't get that one.&quot; He purposefully obliterates the pronunciation of Nicéphore, smothering it in a cool, American accent.</p>
<p>Adam points over Hastar's shoulder. &quot;Make like banana and split.&quot; The tear reopens just behind Hastar, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8aAv-m_KmQ">music and all</a>. &quot;Smooth that concrete over, it wont mind if it knows what's good for it.&quot; He nods toward the dimensional rip which remains open.</p>
<p>&quot;Tell me hombre. You've bathed in the impossible. Who are you?&quot; His voice is smooth and clearly intrigued.</p>

<p>”Who am I?” He repeats, a sly grin grows onto his face.</p>
<p>Pitch darkness rushes through the rift behind him, obscuring Hastar completely.</p>
<p><strong>Drum roll</strong></p>
<p>&quot;You know who I am!&quot; The cloud of absolute darkness ripples, there's movement behind it.</p>
<p>&quot;You've seen me before! The red nose, the undaunted smile, the colorful hair!&quot; The sound of a jacket hitting the floor calls out through the cloud. &quot;Yes, you've seen me, everytime you look in the mirror! Lahahahaha!</p>
<p>A star passes over Prosit 547, as a lone beam of starlight illuminates the clown.</p>
<h2>Hastar has taken a new shape.</h2>
<p>He shoots a hand upwards, pointing towards the light with a cocky smile on his face.</p>

<p>&quot;Who the hell do you think I am? I've saved humanity six times and thanks to Old Gold, I'll be making it seven! With that, my life'll be complete!&quot; The cloud of darkness flushes away from his body, as if a gust of wind came from the sheer presence of his declaration.</p>
<p>&quot;The name's Hastar, the Star of this show! Now who the hell are you!?!&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>A single brow raises at Hastar's magnificent introduction and declaration. The dimensional rip only stays open long enough for Adam to reach in and grab a blunt, though he realizes it's unlit and quickly props its end through the planar edge, pulling it back properly lit. It closes and the music vanishes. He takes a drag just before Hastar asks who the hell he is.</p>
<p>&quot;More prance than dance there, partner. I know you're cooking harder deals than that.&quot; He takes another drag and then offers the blunt to Hastar while holding his breath. A small nod and gesture with a finger alludes that the Hastar need but wait a second.</p>
<p>&quot;...Adam Brando. Haven't saved all of humanity, but a lot of souls under those stars owe me some sugar... You've snared my attention, Klownima. Lay it on me. How'd ya pull six cubs of fate out of the lion's hat?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fate!&quot; Hastar laughs, moving his sunglasses down his nose. &quot;Don't tell me you're still goin' by Her scheming! I mock the very idea!&quot; He happily takes the blunt and gives it a comedically long hit, burning through the ENTIRE blunt. &quot;<em>PAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH</em>&quot; A cloud exists Hastar's mouth, obscuring your vision.</p>
<p>From the cloud, Hastar blows it away to reveal a diary of his. Opening it, the words are clear as day.</p>
<p><strong>No peeping in my diary, weirdo!</strong></p>
<p>He hands back the completely burnt blunt and shrugs. &quot;There's more than meets the eye to we clowns. This-&quot; He gestures to his face. &quot;Is simple make up. The trick is to make it look real enough. The show is, infact what you see with your own two eyes. What happens behind the scenes...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is none of the audiences concern! As for how I did it... I slew a great beast, bargained with The Old One, held my Kingdom's doors tight during the Cruel Ages, prevented the Third World War, ah, I shouldn't tell you the other two. Some secrets are meant to be discovered - if you haven't heard of them, someone already saved your little pile of dirt.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now, how'd a human manage <em>this?</em>&quot; He motions in the air, as if ripping through space. His face scrunches at the lack of result.</p>

<p>Adam nods along, brows raised to Klownima's wonderous tale. &quot;I'm not much for coin-flipping, but we're two sides of the same coin. I stumbled into the rubicon and you stumbled out of it. That ain't my business, though.&quot;</p>
<p>He traces a big circle with his pointer finger, tearing spacetime as he does it and shattering the flat plane all the same in a spectacle of lights. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8aAv-m_KmQ">music returns</a>. &quot;This ain't some hocus-pocus junk. You squash enough fragments, and that rubicon thingamajig gets a clue. Just like in your case, reality knows the drill.&quot;</p>

<p>Walking up fairly cautiously, Kuro's eyes widen at whatever weirdness he had just witnessed.</p>
<p>&quot;That...wasn't some type of holograph or hard-light gear, was it? That didn't seem...yeah no. I have no idea what that was, and I'm not going to pretend to know anything about it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wise move, kid.&quot; Adam looks at Kuro from over a shoulder. &quot;The Needless Rubicon is a logic that fries the logical.&quot;</p>
<p>He looks forward and the rubicon opens up with a rapid swirl, forming a sparkling, shattered oval in space before Adam. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8aAv-m_KmQ">music</a> echoes the instant it begins to form. His voice grows deeper. <em>Darker.</em> &quot;The rubicon will chew the hapless up and spit them out. Like a bullfight between a pit bull and a matador baby.&quot; The portal remains open. Inside can be seen a storm of headache inducing visual and geometric paradoxes and impossibilities.</p>

<p>Kuro frowns at it, putting his hands into his coat pockets to stare for a moment before looking away and shaking his head.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm guessing theirs some sort of trick to it, but just looking at it is enough to give me a migraine. It's not like anything on my earth.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hard-light?&quot; Kuro's gloves glow and blue wisps of light stream out of his palm and twist together, solidifying into a line of energy which he pulls taught. &quot;I'm not sure how it works, but hard-light is really common back home. My maneuvering gear utilizes it and pseudo anti-gravity tech.&quot;</p>
<p>The light dissipates as Kuro let's go of it, and he shrugs as the glow vanishes. &quot;The techs used for everything from small bridges to advertising signs, but you've got to have the right programs and projectors to use it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Heroes?&quot; Kuro puts his hands into his pockets. &quot;The only 'heroes' are the ones the companies glorify over their supposed successes for propaganda.&quot;
The young man stops talking for a moment, shaking himself out. &quot;Sorry, thinking about then gives me the creeps. If you want to talk about real heroes...maybe its the other couriers or operatives from the TUR like myself. Breaking the rules and company property so the little guys get a chance to live a little bit better...and not waste away in a wage slave factory...but nobody is a true 'hero' in that kind of sense.&quot;</p>

<p>Kuro looks away, seemingly deep in thought for a moment. &quot;The TUR is...well...it stands for The Unpaved Road. I don't know how they came up with the name, but there's a few...sides to it I guess.&quot;</p>
<p>The young man shifts to the side, almost staring out into space. &quot;They aren't freedom fights for sure...more of a...way to keep a certain status quo? The world can't survive without these companies running the floating cities, but the TUR and a few other underground groups operate in a way so the companies can't do everything they want to. Destroying batches of food sedatives, small campaigns to keep the public aware of their freedoms. Even raiding automated hubs or other groups if they are doing something they REALLY shouldn't.&quot;</p>
<p>Kuro's equipment glows for another moment, and he brings up his wrist to display what looks like a TUR emblem. &quot;But the TUR also considers itself a business. Package deliveries, information exchanges. Thats the sort of thing courier operatives like me do.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not really a scheme.

On the other, they saved the human race by building the cities. They've continually milked the latter fact for years.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Get that nonsense outta your piehole.&quot;  Adam shoves a thumb over his shoulder with a huff. Another tear in space opens up, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8aAv-m_KmQ">playing the same ominous music</a> again. &quot;You think that's an OS? That's the rubicon, baby.

<p>A soft blue glow envelopes the scattered remains of Maximilian's champagne glass. One by one, the shards slowly dance through the air single file. Swirling streams of pale gold liquid, whatever had remained of the man's drink, lifted itself off the floor and followed closely behind. Eventually all came to rest, floating in front of the small elf girl.</p>
<p>One hand tightly grasps a large tome, securing it against her chest, while her other hand flutters about as if writing something in midair. Three purple symbols appear before her, floating much like the glass and liquid. She taps the first of these runes. Its color shifts to green as the shattered pieces of glass organize themselves back into the familiar fluted shape. The second rune turns green as she presses it, the champagne glass fusing back together into one flawless shape. The last rune follows suit with her touch, glowing green as the swirling liquid finds its home once again inside the glass.</p>
<p>The elf girl reaches out to pluck the floating champagne glass out of the air. The blue glow that once surrounded it fades away. She closely inspects the contents before taking a small sip and looking around at the room's occupants.</p>

<p>The large tome springs to life before the elf girl even has a chance to react. It positions itself between the two, blocking N4NO's view of Faelorei's face. The blank pages swing open and immediately begin filling with characters that morph into something legible by all.</p>

<p>Upon the foreign touch of another, the book quickly recoils back and slams itself shut. The usual blue glow that surrounds the book shifts to a deep red.</p>
<p>Faelorei too, almost in unison, swipes at the hand as the book makes its escape. She peers directly at N4NO, though no anger fills her face, nor any other expression for that manner.</p>
<p>After a few seconds, the book slowly returns to the elf girl's side. Still enveloped in the now crimson light, it opens back up as characters spill onto its pages.</p>

<p>Gil turns his wonderous gaze back to the woman and her magic. &quot;If I may ask, I'd like to know how it is that you are doing this.&quot; He lets out a coarse chuckle before quickly finishing his though. &quot;Not that I should be asking you to reveal your secrets though!&quot;</p>

<p>The elf girl looks herself over while listening to the two before turning to face Mr. DAD. She loosens her grip on the book as it becomes encased in blue light, slipping itself fully out of her grasp and hovering on its own beside her. It quickly opens up, its contents noticeably blank for a moment before alien symbols form on one of the pages. Though they appear foreign and indecipherable at first glance, the symbols quickly reform into a language most familiar to the individual looking their way.</p>

How curious!&quot; He continues, not leaving much room for interjection. &quot;Then I must ask, not to teach me your magic of course, but to tell me weather or not such casting is compatible with my biology!?

<p>Faelorei scribes a single complex rune in the air, its form consisting of several circles and triangles overlayed on top of each other. A blue glow surrounds the rune as she finishes. She taps the rune once, but instead of an instantaneous switch to the usual green hue, only a small portion of the rune shifts color. Slowly, however, the green creeps along the same path in which the rune was constructed.</p>
<p>The elf girl reaches out again, this time grasping the ever-changing rune from the air and chucks it several feet to her right. It lands on the ground below, imprinting itself into the floor. She looks back at DAD and gives him a small wave before her entire body temporarily phases from existence. Almost instantly Faelorei poofs back, standing atop the rune. The book floats on over to her side and writes a new message as elf girl gives a bow.</p>

<p>“Greetings.” Waves the dragon soldier. “I never thought I’d see another Ljósálfar again, or “elves” as they also referred to. Where I come from, they are a nearly depleted race due to being harmed by the scaleless. How are you faring in this unfamiliar realm?”</p>

<p>When the book is summoned, Öskar takes a couple steps by surprise. Of course, in order to read the pages, he had to walk back to where he was and inspect the writing. “Ah… so this is how you communicate… and you’re capable of magic too.” The dragon thinks out loud after what he witnessed.</p>
<p>When he learns that a race similar to his exists in Faelorei’s world, he becomes quite giddy. “There’s dragonkin from where you hail? Please, you must tell me more! It’d be fascinating to learn the differences in culture and relations to other races. <em>Ahem</em>… but its only fair I answer your inquiries first.” He clears his throat and prepares to share his background. “You are partially correct. My lineage is not royal, but it is rare. I am half Sky dragon and half Shadow dragon. The former is how I gained my wings, and the latter is a much rarer race of dragons said to be the strongest and most advanced of all of them. There are other kinds such as Earth, Leaf, Magma, Rain, and Snow dragons, each with their own attributes and prefered living spaces.”</p>
<p>He offers a bow of his own to Faelorei. “My name is Öskar the Ready. As someone with great respect for Ljósálfar, I am honored to be acquainted with you.”</p>

<p>A look of relief is made. “Good to here your kind is thriving. I’d say having an whole island to themselves hs definitely helped in their survival. Part of the downfall of the Ljósálfar was that they offered my ancestors sanctuary after the Scaleless expelled them from their society. They unfortunately got wrapped up in our conflict… and the Scaleless wasted no time ravaging their lands. Ljósálfar weren’t as hardy nor battle ready as dragonkin. So their numbers dwindled exponentially. Nowadays its a miracle to see any remaining survivors. I’m aware some females are allegedly locked away in red light districts of the Scaleless to perform parlor tricks and… miscellaneous unmentionable acts against their will.” He shudders just sharing this unpleasant information.</p>
<p>“I’d be happy to share more info about the other dragons. <strong>Earth</strong> has the largest population by far. They’re fairly widespread yet don’t have many unique traits. <strong>Leaf</strong> is the second most common and reside in forests and jungles. They’re the most maligned among ourselves as they not only eventually aligned with Scaleless… they in turn betrayed the Ljósálfar. <strong>Magma</strong> is a bit less widespread and reside near volcanic areas. They are perfectly capable of breathing fire without issue, unlike us where can it can seriously damage our throats if used more than occasionally. <strong>Rain</strong> tends to reside wherever a body of water may be, but particularly the seas. They can breathe underwater and operate as merchants to all races. <strong>Snow</strong> is quite rare, but not nearly as rare as Shadow, and they inhabit tundras. They breathe beams of ice from their mouths and rarely leave their settlements. I have only seen 9 Snow dragons during my lifetime.”</p>

<p>Öskar takes a break to allow the petite elf a chance to follow along, and then asks an eager question of his own. “Tell me more about these sky dragon sisters. What makes them especially popular?”</p>

<p>Faelorei listens intently as Öskar talks about the Ljósálfar's demise and draconic variations. The remains open, though angled towards the elf girl. Perculiar symbols appear on its pages, though unlike when it was used to communicate with the dragon man, these alien characters remain in their indecipherable state. Every so often, the text fades into the pages, only to be replaced more as the cycle continues onward.</p>
<p>As the question is raised about the sky dragon sisters, Faelorei twirls a finger to reorient the book towards Öskar. Any characters still on the page vanish, overwritten by a response.</p>

<p>“Fascinating…” Comments the lieutenant when learning about the Sky Dragon Sisters. “Their powers sound quite similar to the goddess Móðir Dreki, our Mother Dragon. She is said to have been the ancestor of all dragonkin, and created the lovely lands that we walk on. It is written that Móðir Dreki currently sleeps in the heavens. Someday, she will descend back to the earth, and it is believed it is after we reclaim our lands the Scaleless stole from us! I’m sure these sisters are as lovely as you say, but they will surely pale in comparison to Móðir Dreki.” He wistfully looks upwards with stars in his eyes.</p>
<p>The dragon becomes concerned when hearing Faelorei’s world deals with similar strife. “Oh dear. Don’t tell me your people are oppressed by sapes too? Poor Ljósálfar… they can’t catch a break. Well, elvenkind such as yourself are always welcome in Lohikærme, the nation of Dragonkin. I’d be delighted to give you tour once this game is over, provided I don’t fall in battle. Not that I plan on dying anytime soon.” He scoffs confidently.</p>

<p>Faelorei nods and appears to summon something into the palm of her hand with a quick flash, though nothing seems to be there. She seemingly holds this nothing with both hands, peering into the empty void as her book comes to her aid once again.</p>

<p>Öskar nods excitedly in agreement. His tail wags behind him like a puppy. “Sounds like a deal, Faelorei! I’m sure your cottage is quite perfectly comfy. The architecture of Ljósálfar always appeared so whimsical; making use of the nature around them to create their homes. Our own homes are typically created of marble or cobalt, to reduce any chances of an accidental fire. Since… you know, some dragons can breathe it. The last thing you want is for your house to burn because you accidentally sneezed.”</p>

<p>Adam approaches the elf with an inquisitive look on his face. Standing a few feet apart, he looks  angles her for a few seconds before coolly commenting, &quot;Peter Jackson woke something up in everyone, but dare I say they're still asleep. The name's Adam Brando.&quot; He reaches a hand to his side and a flat tear in spacetime opens up with the visual spectacle of shattering glasses of light that dissipate into glowing dust that promptly disappear. As soon as the portal opens <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8aAv-m_KmQ">music</a> begins to play, but it and the tear vanish only a second later when the man pulls out an empty champagne glass of his own.</p>
<p>Lightly tilting the glass toward Faelorei, Adam offers a subtle grin with raised brows. &quot;You've lit a fire that needs putting out like a chef's first knife in overtime,&quot; he tips the glass a little bit more toward Faelorei, &quot;and I'm thirsty.&quot; His smile grows. A tiny bit.</p>

<p>Faelorei reaches out with her own glass, delicately touching it to Adam's. Her other hand lets go of the book as it quickly begins etching a rune in the air. The book lights up with a blue hue and positions itself next to the elf. The rune itself begins to glow purple as it is completed. She taps the rune once, purple turning to green as champagne fills the man's glass until its volume matches that of her own.</p>
<p>Pulling back her own drink, she takes a sip as the book opens up towards Adam and begins spelling something out upon its pages.</p>

<p>&quot;Groovy.&quot; He immediately brings the glass to his lips. As he gently pulls it back he gives Faelorei a nod. &quot;Hits the spot.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Powerful name there, Faelorei. Enough to cage my curiosity.&quot; He takes another sip of his drink, looks down at it, then back up at the elf. &quot;Call it a hunch that I'll need to do more than just clink glasses with a woman like you to get you talking.&quot;</p>
<p>He gestures to his side. &quot;I'm not a fan of desserts with wine, and we've got a popsicle stand to blow. Let's walk and read, baby.&quot;</p>

<p>Faelorei's champagne begins to bubble with increased vigor, growing more rapidly by the second until a flame sprouts from the surface of her drink. The glass, too, begins to melt in her hand as it quickly loses its flawless form. The flame speards, engulfing both the glass and her hand in a red hot ball of fire.</p>
<p>The elf girl looks around the room, her eyes darting every which way before shooting back to Adam. The book maneuvers itself to avoid the grasped inferno as it refreshes its pages.</p>

<p>Adam shoves a thumb over his shoulder. A large window in spacetime shatters behind him in a burst of light and immediately barfs out the remains of a pile broken lemonade stand with the word lemonade crossed out and replaced with 'PoPSIcLE'. Of course, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8aAv-m_KmQ">music</a> spills out, too, for the ten or so seconds that debris crashes down onto the ballroom floor. &quot;Copy that, sugar. Let's make some quick work and skedaddle.&quot; He waits for Faelorei and the portal closes a few seconds after the pile settles.</p>

<p>Heat swells with intensity as the ball of fire grows larger and larger in the elf girl's hand. She turns to face the PoPSIcLE pile and with her other hand, she forms a single blue rune. Without warning, she flings the giant blazing fireball high into the air. At the apex of its trajectory, she taps the rune in front of her. As rune activates, shifting to green, the infernal ball immediately corrects its course and rushes straight towards the wooden remains.</p>
<p><strong>KERBLAM</strong></p>
<p>A massive fiery explosion rocks the ballroom, smoke and flames being sent in every direction. As the smoke clears, however, it appears everyone and everything was spared even a tiny burn. That is except for the PoPSIcLE stand, which was completely vaporized. Not even its ashen corpse remained.</p>
<p>The book relays a new message before landing back in Faelorei's hands as she begins to walk off.</p>

<p>Luscious stands statue still in the middle of the room, sword at the ready. It would be easy to mistake him for an incredibly gaudy ornament were it not for his two bright blue eyes flitting from face to face. Eventually, with a small creak, he shifts, dropping his guarded stance. Small flecks of blood stain the otherwise immaculate blade, and a visible hairline fracture runs along its length.</p>
<p>Luscious turns his head to Maximilian von Blitz and points his armoured index finger at him, gold glinting in the light. He stays like that, pointing, for a couple of seconds, before turning his head to look at his finger, then back at Maximilian.</p>
<p>“Sorcery.” His voice echoes out loudly from his helmet. Luscious gives a wet cough before once again staying statue still, as if unsure what to do.</p>

<p>&quot;A knight.&quot; The unit approaches the armored figure, stepping towards it before suddenly lurching forward, almost slithering as its elongated body uncomfortably closely inspects the man's armor and sword. &quot;Not quite historical.

<p>Luscious holds his ground, clearly ecstatic to be the centre of attention. “I do not dabble in wizardry, my overly eager friend, but I am of magical nature! My armour and sword have been passed down for generations, each wielded by mighty heroes. They are nigh indestructible!”</p>
<p>Luscious strikes a pose and flexes. This is obviously completely pointless as his muscles are hidden by a solid inch of pure gold.</p>
<p>“And you my similarly armoured friend of strange proportions? Is that creepy armour enchanted?” He continues flexing, clearly not paying much attention.</p>

It is immaculate, for no evildoer has ever managed to land a blow on me!” Whether this is true or not, it is an obvious point of pride for Luscious.</p>

<p>“No amount of ‘sorcery’ would ever change how garish that armor is.” Jeered Öskar who walks from behind Luscious to his right. He looks at the golden hulking knight, scoffing after looking over the Evergolden.  “What is it with sapes and their obsessions with jewelry and precious metals? They’re just colored rocks and minerals! I don’t get it nor think I ever will.”</p>

<p>“I am Öskar the Ready. Lieutenant of the 6th Platoon of Lohikærme.” He taps the butt of his spear on the floor.</p>
<p>A sudden intrigue is invoked within the dragonkin. “So looks do not deceive. You truly are one of strength… and apparently character. Tell me, Sir Luscious, what guides your actions? What defines just, or morally grey?” He leans back agaisnt a nearby pillar as he awaits an answer.</p>

<p>“The morally grey are those who are good and bad. Like cookies with raisins in them or those strange shaved cats. I usually don’t bother with them.”</p>

<p>“… I see.” Affirms Öskar as he listens to the knight’s rationalizations. He appears neither disappointed nor impressed. One of the things caught the dragon’s attention however. “You’re telling me putting raisins in cookies is a culinary practice where you come from? Jeez… Sapes really do have some foul taste in food.” His revulsion couldn’t be any more clear.</p>
<p>It was Öskar’s turn to display some confidence. “Not just a warrior. A soldier. An <em>elite</em> soldier! I helped my army in many skirmishes against the scaleless, and one battle that reclaimed our seaport to the west earned my title! I fell many enemies on the battlefield… and have yet to lose.” He looks over Luscious restlessly, eventually gaining a confident stance. “Sir Luscious, would you ever be opposed to a sparring match? I won’t use my wings to gain an unfair advantage.”</p>

When he speaks again, there is a slight wheeze in his mighty voice.</p>
<p>“My apologies, I would love to spar, but I was recently in a very ferocious battle. I vanquished my foe, of course, but I am a little worse for wear. Perhaps ask me again in a few hours.” He clears his throat, and the wheeze is gone.</p>
<p>“It fills me with joy to know that I am in the company of a fellow great warrior. Once evil rears its ugly head, we shall dispatch it swiftly and without mercy.”</p>

<p>Öskar squints his eyes suspiciously at the golden knight, as if he doesn't entirely buy the convenient excuse put forth. Ultimately the dragon doesn’t question it and simply sighs in disappointment. “A pity. To think we’d be able to test our mettle right away. I suppose we must wait until you’re feeling better.”</p>
<p>He rests his azure lance over his shoulder. “I too am relieved there is someone of capable battle prowess. If fortune help it, perhaps we might be on the same team. That’d be something, wouldn’t it Sir Luscious?”</p>

<p>Luscious turns to face Kuro, armour clanking slightly as he does. For a second, it looks like Luscious’ eyes physically light up, bright blue almost becoming fluorescent. He sheathes his sword, before placing a heavy gauntlet on Kuro’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“A fan! I do not recognise your arcane ramblings, but that is not of importance! Evil is afoot, you must stay behind me if you are to survive.” Luscious’ voice booms from his armour, somehow at a louder volume than before. He positions himself between Kuro and Maximilian, before drawing his sword and lifting it up in the air. He strikes a well practiced pose, armour once again glinting madly.</p>
<p>Luscious, still holding the pose, looks over his shoulder at Kuro. “Say, random citizen, you wouldn’t happen to know where we are, would you?”</p>

<p>Kuro, seemingly unfazed by the warrior's loud voice, closes his eyes for a moment, but then opens one as he looks up to where Maximilian is. &quot;Not a random citizen.

<p>He walks around Luscious to the side, looking at his wrist display again and tapping it once before lowering it. &quot;Anyways, I doubt keeping your sword pointed at the guy will help anyone. He brought us all here, who knows what he's capable of?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Incredible!&quot; he exclaims!

Hahaha, the final frontier here in my grasp, a lifetime to unravel all this ship's secrets, not enough! Not nearly. How this would change everything back home! Possibilities, possibilities.&quot;</p>
<p>But in a snap, his eyes focus on all the other individuals milling about, and he's suddenly aware of everyone's presence.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh.&quot;</p>
<p>With one hand on chin, Oscar ponders the scene silently, a bit of worry across his eyebrows.</p>

<p>After a bit of hesitation, Oscar extends his hand for a handshake. &quot;Well. To introduce myself first, my name is Oscar Keavarus, researcher into fields of Chaos Theory, dynamic systems, and dimensional maps. My works have seen accredited peer-reviewed recognition in the scientific community alongside global summits, so I hope to one day apply my findings to unravelling the mysteries of our world and seize its possibilities for my own hand.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Speaking of maps...&quot;
Soto pulls out a piece of ragged paper from his jacket and unfurls it.
&quot;I got one to some of the finest treasures in the world!&quot;
On inspection, the map appears to be a semi-accurate drawing of the world scribbled without the use of so much as a ruler. What seems to be random coastlines and island in the south are circled in red. The outside of the map is covered in various doodles and half-finished calculations.</p>

<p>Soto looks at his hand and twirls it around in the light.
&quot;Haharr, yes, quite a story indeed. I was out sailing with me crew on the high seas, when we assaulted by a vicious group of rival pirates. In the midst of a heated conflict, I used the hand to block a direct pistol shot at one of me comrades, saving the wee lad's life, and catching the shooter off guard enough to finish him for good. After the fighting was over, I took the enemy captain's prosthetic and replaced my own ragged hand with it, to stem the bleeding.&quot;</p>
<p>He stops and looks up to see if Oscar believes his story. Before he can properly gauge a reaction though, he sighs and continues on.
&quot;Okay, in reality I slipped and broke it while mining guano, and had to get the blasted thing amputated once it went started goin' a funny color. Keep that between us though, aye?
Soto's voice goes low and serious for a moment.
&quot;The story may not be good, but the hook still mighty sharp. Took the thing right through the skull of a man once, and that's no lie. He didn't mock me crew no more after that, I'll tell ye.&quot;
...
&quot;O' course, I would never do such a thing at a formal event such as this! We're all gentlemen here, aint we? Haharrrr&quot;</p>

<p>Oscar gives a hearty laugh when the pirate finishes, and says &quot;Of course not, of course not Captain, we're all gentlemen. But I have to tell you, it's my principle that a good story shouldn't be concerned about the truth. And it's a shame - thought it was noble of you to risk life and limb for the sake of a crewmate. You seem a good man.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But most importantly, have you ever hit it big? Finding buried treasure, or perhaps plundering a ship of riches, that sort of proud pirate stories to tell in a tavern?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll tell ye though, me eyepatch is a tad interesting. Originally, had the thing on my perfectly good right eye, a little intimidation tactic, ya see. Some drunken scurvy dog thought they were real clever when they got my left with a broken bottle. Had to switch the thing mid-fight!&quot;
He chuckles to himself.

<p>&quot;How many fights do you get into, goodness. A damn scrappy seadog that makes you, Captain, and I'm sure that keeps your men in line.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But as for me?&quot; Oscar mulls over the thought over, until saying &quot;Well, I couldn't imagine sailing the seas as anything other than a captain, charting my own course through the seas. But if that puts me at odds with the fearsome Captain Soto then I best save my own hide on land, in my laboratory charting unexplored waters on that front.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, that is a term I am familiar with,&quot; N4NO nods, speaking more enthusiastically. &quot;The idea that small events can influence much larger happenings to some degree. A rather perplexing thought, isn't it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course! Imagine harnessing this power. Imagine, if you will, <em>knowing</em> what the end result will become. The ancient alchemics imagined this sort of 'magic' in their own crude way, but in a roundabout turn, hundreds of years later the principals of Chaos Theory can lead to the wildest results of even the most mundane experiments, simple combinations of worthless liquids into the elixir of life! And with the hundreds of other variables controlled, even more unexpected avenues, unpredictable under the tiniest of circumstance alterations, until now.&quot;</p>
<p>Oscar stops himself in his tracks. With a soft laugh he says &quot;Ah, I don't mean to talk your ear off. Others have always told me I can't be stopped on these tangents and passions, so I'll hold myself back for you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Rather,&quot; he murmurs as he peers over Nano, &quot;do you truly have an individual consciousness? Something... standalone? From my rudimentary knowledge I only know of host systems far too large to fit inside your frame.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Individual consciousness...&quot; N4NO ponders this for a brief moment before continuing, &quot;I do have an individual personality and consciousness. Each personal companion cyborg that is crafted by the MACROSS corporation is uniquely engineered, although all cyborg personalities are initially influenced by global AI systems - what you would call a 'host' system, I assume.&quot;</p>

<p>Oscar nods along in admiration. &quot;Incredible! Literal saviors of humanity.

<p>Heavy footfalls herald the knight’s arrival. It seems like the armour really is as heavy as it looks.</p>
<p>“Ah, a mage.” Luscious places an armoured hand on Oscar’s shoulder. “I would like to request a simple transportation spell, Arcus needs their greatest hero.” He pauses for a second. “And if you could add some sort of visual effect to herald my arrival, that would be lovely.”</p>

<p>Oscar's head pops up at Luscious's thundering arrival. &quot;Goodness! You startled me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And I'm not a <em>mage</em>,&quot; he scoffs, &quot;but I suppose it's as the quote says where science becomes indistinguishable at a sufficiently high level. Well, from what you appear, perhaps mages are the science in your world. No matter! Let's see how I compare.&quot;</p>
<p>Oscar pulls a coin out of his pocket. &quot;For a transportation spell, you say? How will that manifest.&quot; Furrowing his brow, he stares at his hand in concentration, and finally, flips the coin.</p>
<p><em>Ting!</em> Slowly, it rises. It hangs in the air. And at its apex, the coin bubbles like a boiling liquid, purple steam bubbling out, morphing in place like a tear in reality, until with a <em>crash!</em> something solid and heavy falls to the ground.</p>
<p>It's a tricycle!</p>
<p>&quot;Haha! And with that, here is your transportation, sir. Chaos theory makes the impossible possible to great effect, wouldn't you say?&quot; as Oscar beams in triumph.</p>

<p>Luscious stares blankly at Oscar. He scratches the side of his helmet, perhaps unaware of the fact that this achieves nothing. “That was silly. You are a silly man, and you make words up.”</p>
<p>He walks over to the tricycle, armour clanking slightly as he does. He points down at it. “This is the vehicle that will transport me, correct?” Before Oscar has the chance to answer, Luscious sits down on the small bike and instantly flattens it.</p>
<p>“Ah, my apologies. It seems your spell was too flimsy to handle my mightiness. Perhaps I will have to seek my own means back home.” Luscious is still sat on what remains of the tricycle. “What is your name, silly man?”</p>

<p>Oscar's face flashes red as he utters &quot;How dare y--&quot; but he stops. He takes a deep breath.</p>
<p>&quot;My name is Oscar Keavarus, researcher into fields of Chaos Theory, dynamic systems, and dimensional maps. My works have seen accredited peer-reviewed recognition in the scientific community alongside global summits, so I hope to one day apply my findings to unravelling the mysteries of our world and our future.&quot;</p>
<p>Appraising the man in front of him from head to toe, Oscar continues &quot;Perhaps we should take a step back. As you can see, I've got a bit of 'magic' in my step, and you're quite the physical specimen. If you'll be making demands then let's arrange an exchange.

<p>Luscious stands up, the flattened remains of the tricycle sticking to his armour for a couple of seconds before it falls back on the ground. “Oscar. That is a good name for a mage. I see now that you are not silly. You are simply unsound of mind, perhaps caused by whatever black magics that brought us here.”</p>
<p>Luscious looks over his shoulders, to show that the aforementioned black magics could be lurking anywhere. “There is no such thing as science, or peer-reviews. That is the devil’s speech.” He stands tall once again. “However, I would be more than happy to be of assistance. What did you have in mind, young Oscar the Mage of Questionable Sanity?”</p>

<p>He remains there in misery. &quot;But...but Goldie sold me a big package deal on Galactic-Kidnapping-and-Coercion-Into-a-Coliseum-Free-for-All-With-Planets-At-Stake replacement and recovery plan! It was a nonrefundable deposit!&quot;</p>
<p>Sniffling, he gets up and eyedrops some tears onto his face, which don't smudge the make up at all. &quot;My hard earned pesos... I'd been practically slaving away for a millenium!&quot; The sad clown continues mopeing, the yellow of his jacket quickly turning to blue. &quot;Anyways, since it seems we're already well acquaintanced, I suppose I can let you peer into my deepest darkest secrets - truthfully, the show was already underway before I'd been introduced!

<p>He continues listening to the scientist’s explanation. At times the lieutenant appears lost, but never seems bored. “It sounds like your field of study is a massive undertaking. You must've underwent many years of research to uncover all that information, didn’t you? Such work reminds me of the alchemists where I live. Never ceasing to find answers. Impressive work.”</p>
<p>“As for myself,” Öskar prepares to share his own background, “it’s actually not a case of ‘difficult alliances’ as you say. On the contrary, my people have been in an ongoing war against the scaleless, who you probably know as humans. I’ve been in the army for several years, from a scrappy recruit to the lieutenant I currently am. Battle prowess made a name for myself. It wasn’t easy… I was secretly mocked for being a half breed and having a handsome face, but eventually I earned the Ready title. I just hope my soldiers are fairing well without my aid.” The somber note gives the dragon pause and he sighs while staring at the ceiling.</p>

Yes, of course it's a turbulent road, but it's all worth it for the success at the end of the rainbow so to speak, especially in fields... similar to alchemy I suppose. Chaos Theory is still the untamed beast. In your case, your goal's for the men you lead. It must be a burden. Although I can't speak for them, surely a soldier only risks their life for a man worthy to be their leader, of course? Can't imagine a world otherwise.&quot;</p>

<p>“An astute observation.” Agrees Öskar with a nod. “When I was still in the lower ranks, the morale is much higher when I had faith in my superiors. It took me several years to earn promotions and respect, and likewise it probably took years to gain progress on unlocking this Chaos Theory. Nothing is handed to you immediately. Indeed, everything in life is earned.”</p>
<p>The lieutenant handwaves nonchalantly at Oscar’s offer. “I appreciate the accommodation, but there’s no need. Even if you’re human as you claim, you don’t resemble the Scaleless I know, so you dont invoke visceral emotions unlike… some others here.” He glares at a handful of select few people before resuming his friendly disposition.</p>

<p>Four dudes show up in the ballroom. &quot;God dammit, Kuwabara!&quot; You hear a voice erupt. Seems like one of the boys is shouting at the other. &quot;I told you not to touch that shit! Now we're in space. Good luck figuring out how to get all of us back down.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Man, why don't you relax! 'Sides, Takada was the one who made me bump into it. I'm just sayin' it ain't <em>my</em> fault, Tonegawa.&quot; The berated fellow replies.</p>
<p>&quot;Knock it off, you two.&quot; One of them says plainly. &quot;First things first. While the rest of The Boys are resting up, let's get our bearings straight...&quot;</p>
<p>The fourth one chimes in. &quot;...Thanks for cuttin' 'em off, boss Murakami. And although it ain't all <em>that</em> relevant, hm...  seriously, just room for us all...? Whatever, I guess. Better than nothin' at all.&quot; he finishes with a shrug.</p>
<p>&quot;...Trust me, Okamoto, that was actually one of my first problems here.&quot; replies Murakami.</p>

<h2>Hastar has taken a new shape.</h2>

<p>While the boys weren't looking, someone snuck into their group. Normally, it'd be easy to tell if someone had... but this creature, he learns. He shifts. He shapes.</p>
<p>There are now <strong>24 boys</strong>. One just happens to have a red nose, and clown wig. And looks a bit older. Still hip and cool though.</p>
<p>&quot;You tell 'em Murakami!&quot;</p>
<p>He looks over his shoulder at Takada. &quot;Aye Takada, you almost done with my manga? Next volume's comin' in just half a day! Don't hog the pages man!&quot;</p>

<p>Takada looks back for a moment and snickers. &quot;Man, you know I don't read comic books and shit.&quot; He foregoes noticing the clown wig and red nose, having mercy.</p>
<p>&quot;You prolly meant to ask me, man.&quot; Yamashita chimes in. &quot;But my boy, you'll be gettin' it back when you cut it out with that goofy ass getup.&quot; He laughs.</p>

<p>N4NO looks visibly dumbfounded as she spots the group of men from across the room. Steadily approaching, she addresses the man she heard referred to as &quot;boss Murakami,&quot; assuming he is the leader. &quot;It is <em>most</em> unusual to see a group of humans in the flesh these days! And your fashion is most interesting, if not outdated where I come from.&quot; N4NO offers her hand to Murakami and smiles, her blue eyes flickering as she scans the group. &quot;My name is N4NOR1NA, though you may call me N4NO if you'd like. How were all of you able to get aboard this ship?&quot;</p>

<p>Murakami furrows his brow as he quickly reaches for the handshake, as hesitation would be cowardly behavior. As he shakes your hand, you hear the slight creaking of metal come from yourself. &quot;Yeah, name's Murakami. Brought The Boys together.&quot;
&quot;Kuwabara.&quot; The guy introduces himself with pride in his voice as he motions towards himself with a thumb.
&quot;Tonegawa...&quot; He says with slight annoyance in his voice.
&quot;Okamoto.&quot; He says, staring off elsewhere.
&quot;Takada.&quot; The one with glasses introduces himself with a grin.</p>
<p>&quot;As for how we all got here together...&quot; Tonegawa mutters, motioning a thumb back between Kuwabara and Takada. You get the feeling he probably blames them. &quot;Lots of weird shit back home. Been teleported before. Can't ever say it's been to space, though.&quot; Tonegawa finishes with a sigh.</p>

<p>Adam looks over his shoulder and sees the boys. As if smashing the side of his fist against a doorbell, he crashes a hand through spacetime itself, opening a flat plane between his position and the boys. It shatters like glass made of light and immediately bleeds out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8aAv-m_KmQ">loud music</a>. He sidesteps through it and appears beside the crowd. The portal remains open both here and where he was before. Staring into it exposes a swirling mess of impossible geometry and paradoxical sights, enough to easily give one a quick headache.</p>
<p>&quot;Cut it out, goose brigade.&quot; His voice is cool and level. &quot;Goldilocks over there thinks you're a half ton of nothing. Prove him right like a barrel of chicks dumped in a garbage disposal if you want, or get your ducks in a row and ditch this nonsense.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well well well boys, whatta we got here?&quot; a new face appears, strolling in from the background. Takada has appeared. The four look back, and two of them are grinning widely. Anticipation awaits. The boy adjusts his glasses slightly upwards with a finger, as he then spreads his arms out and slings 'em around the shoulders of two in the group. He has a few laughs with them before turning and making eye contact with Adam.</p>
<p>&quot;They say birds used to be dinosaurs, ya know. You wanna fuck with a flock, or make merry? Sounds easy to me, man.&quot; He says flatly, lifting his arms off the others' shoulders.</p>
<p>&quot; 'Sides all that, we've stepped through the Fires of Tormentia. We've fought many upon the Field of Raised Ruin. We even strolled through the Sepulchers of Tormented Souls like it was fuckin' nothing to us, man. You ever stroll through anything but that portal and ya mom's cooch? Eh?&quot; He waits.</p>

<p>&quot;A C-section baby, then. That's rough, man. Hope you find your way some day.&quot;</p>
<p>The Boys wear worried expressions as they turn their gazes to you and collectively shake their heads, staring at you as if they harbored pity for a decrepit man. Their eyes finally close as their heads turn down with sadness, setting a solemn stage for which this poor man can jump off of.</p>

&quot;Names Soto, respectible merchant yet ferocious terror of the high seas. It's a pleasure to meet ye. Don't worry, you've caught me at a good time. So I won't be plundering this here vessel....

<p>Noticing the captain's disheveled appearance and peculiar way of speaking, N4NO cautiously approaches, eyes flickering slightly. Her voice is much like a tour guide's as she explains, &quot;Ah, you are a pirate?

<p>A towering, gangly statue of metals and plastics stands in the room. After a long moment of unmoving stillness, it begins to swivel its pale, blank face around, surveying the room.</p>
<p>&quot;All of them, unchipped.&quot; Though it may have some sort of metal jaw under its white, mask-like face, the solemn voice doesn't seem to come from its unmoving maw.</p>

<p>&quot;35 years, since I have had to last speak to an artificial intelligence. Far too short.&quot; It makes no effort to look closer at the machine in front of it, its echoing voice heavy. &quot;A basic, bastardized idealization of human intelligence. Look at yourself.&quot;</p>
<p>If it could spit, it sounds like it would be. &quot;A form mimicking the proportions of a human woman, but grotesquely distorted to be more... pleasant. Nonthreatening. Legs shortened to be like those of a small animal's. A visage fat and stupid, like that of a baby's. And... antennae? Protruding from your artificial hair, no doubt designed to recall the ears of some 'cute' animal.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm... Is that so?&quot; It suddenly lurches forward, bending down towards the man, mere inches away from his face.</p>
<p>&quot;If that is the case, then it does not appear to communicate on any frequencies that I am familiar with.&quot; After staring at the man's face for a moment longer, it slowly withdraws, standing back up to its full height. &quot;You say you are <em>likely</em> chipped. How can you be unaware of whether or not you are chipped or not? Perhaps we have different ideas of the meaning of the word 'chipped.' I am referring to those with integrated circuits connected directly to their central nervous system.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;ahhh I see, that kind of chipping.  Im pretty sure that my handler added some sort of augmentation to me during training. Transmitting and processing datastreams of consciousness through Windows Enterprise '23 isn't the kind of task normal people are burdened with I suppose. Thinking back on it, I believe the previous DAD also went through some light augmentation.&quot;<br />
Mr DAD kinda smirks
&quot;I guess you could say that I'm a <em>chipped</em> off the old block&quot;</p>

<p>“Uhh…” the sound of car wheels slowly rolling up comes to a halt before these two relics talkin’ shop. “Dads are <em>like</em>. Guys that make babies? You know?

<p>&quot;Well sorta, you see my title was derived from the old term Dad which indeed were the guys who contacted the Crane baby delivery services&quot;
&quot;In my world prior the Global DAD program, we were plagued by a technological menace which turned the minds of the youth to mush: Tok Tik&quot; DAD says with a grimmace.
&quot;Fatherless behavior spread like wildfire and we almost reached a tipping point where all of the youths were lost to this Chinese application. From the jaws of despair the Global DAD organization began its first assault on the world, with the backing of several world leaders and governments volunteer Dads would be the moral pillar stone of each community freeing the minds of the youths from the horrors of nonstop doom scrolling. Those that accepted Dads into their lives reach prosperity and those who rejected the Dad program were <em>delt with</em> in another way.  Fast forward a bit and the worlds nations all rallied behind this program which allowed us to combine our efforts for the betterment of humanity. It got to a point where death was pretty much eradiated from the normal persons life! With the power of technology the world doesn't need hundreds of thousands of Dads, but rather project the mind/thoughts of one man to act as the global moral compass and man you can rely on. Daily i host hundreds of thousands parties, grill outs, baseball games, scouting events. And through these events I (or rather parts of my consciousness) interact with the population and support their every need.&quot;</p>

<p>“<em>One Dad for everyone… kinda like how all neo humans have Computer…?</em>” She questions to herself. DD becomes uncharastically silent and somber hearing DAD retell the horrors of tok tik, shaken only when her mind starts to draw conclusions. MoMo’s driver door slams shut and out rushes Dekka up to DAD. “But wait! W-what about the Moms? Did they all disappear too? Is motherless behavior just as scary sounding as n-not having a Dad?”</p>

<p>&quot;Dekka my dear, that is exactly right, I connect to my children through a computer as well.&quot; Dad lets out a small chuckle
&quot;Mothers in my earth are quite strong, I could not hope to fulfil the roll of every mom on the planet if I were to attempt it I would shrivel up to stress during my first week.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Motherless behavior is scarier than fatherless behavior and luckily the mothers of each family unit have a firm handle on the situation&quot;</p>

&quot;Ah, you see. before being 'invited' onto this ship I was grandDAD'd out of the program. DAD '24 is starting his first day today&quot;</p>

<h1>THE DAY 1 EVENT</h1>
<p>The golden man stands at the edge of the balcony, and taps on a wineglass. Who knows where he got it, he broke the last one.</p>
<p>&quot;Your attention,&quot; he says, as the sound of the glass rings throughout the entire ship. &quot;We have prepared an event for you which may allow you some advantage in the following phase.&quot;</p>
<p>A spotlight shines towards a massive set of double doors on the edge of the ballroom. Suddenly, it bursts open, as the butler and maid from earlier come in wheeling what appears to be a massive kitchen, bigger than any you've ever seen. It looks like it should be too heavy for them, even with the wheels making it portable, but they manage.</p>
<p>Every cooking implement imaginable is there in the kitchen, every kind of pot or pan, grater, blender, knife, cleaver, kettle. Stoves of various kinds, electric, wood-burning, an oven, a charcoal grill, even a regular old fire pit is there. Surely that should be a hazard?</p>
<p>Maximilian claps, and you turn your attention back to him. &quot;In nearly all Earths, life emerges from consuming other life. And so, consumption is what will happen here.&quot; He points to the kitchen--
The maid and butler are gone, but lying on counters are a large bucket of mid-sized trilobites, and the corpses of a full-grown stegosaur and a terror bird.</p>
<p>&quot;This exercise will require a partner. One of you will prepare a meal using one of the creatures here. If you lack knowledge of butchery, we can provide you with pre-cut or cleaned pieces on request. In fact, we can give you any complementary meat or vegetable you have ever heard of, probably more.&quot;</p>

<p>The unit looks at the kitchen, as well as the unprepared food, for a silent moment. &quot;I am at a disadvantage without participating.&quot; It surveys the people preparing and eating the food with a silent stare. &quot;I will have to find some other way, then.&quot;</p>

<p>Kuro approaches almost without a sound but makes his presence known with a heavy sigh, walking up next to UNIT-13BM and takes a look over at the trilobites. &quot;Back home the staple for pretty much everyone is ramen and nutrient packs, but if someone's desperate enough for a bite they roast up insects on fire, grill, or anything hot enough they can find. Couldn't be that hard to throw in some salt and put them in an oven for a bit.&quot;</p>

<p>He turns to the large humanoid machine. &quot;I guess the questions I've got is can you eat them, or do you have to be the one to cook in this situation?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will have to cook. I am unable to process nonhuman biomass.&quot; It picks up a kitchen knife and begins cutting and cleaning the pieces of prehistoric meat, choosing the meat of the <strong>Terror Bird,</strong> with mechanical speed and precision. &quot;All I know of cooking is from viewing others. I cannot taste, so I cannot verify its quality. I can only make sure it appears fully cooked.&quot;</p>
<p>It washes the knife before cutting some vegetables with equally mechanical speed and precision. With this, it covers the large chunks of meat and the chopped vegetables in vegetable oil before spreading them out on a baking try and sliding them into the oven.</p>
<p>When it takes them out, the resulting foods... don't smell bad, at least. It looks like everything is thoroughly cooked. &quot;It is finished.&quot; It puts the various roasted meats and vegetables on a plate. If one were to try it, it would be... okay. Maybe a little worse than okay. Underseasoned and undersalted, at least. Startlingly normal, given the exotic ingredients.</p>

&quot;Yargh, it be looking like a fine meal, no maggots in sight. Would be a shame to waste such a thing.&quot;
Soto picks up some of the food and suddenly crams it in his mouth, in a rather startling manner. Between loud chomping and chewing sounds, the captain appears to say:
&quot;Rather well-done, a hearty dish indeed. Could use a wee bit o' sea salt though.&quot;</p>
<p>He samples a few more pieces, trying his best not to let any get stuck in his beard.

<p>&quot;Excellent choice, I shall see what I can toss together for this lovely crowd&quot;
~~(Dish descriptions and cooking to be written tomorrow morning as the player is abit eepy after a busy day of League of Legends and school projects)~~</p>

<p>After a brief pause dad dons a head band and grabs a few butcher knives and begins chopping into the stegosaurus with a light murderous rage and a bit too much precision for a normal man.  After unearthing the massive tenderloin he cuts it into 24 evenly slices pieces and seasons generously with salt and pepper.<br />
&quot;Oh man, what spectacular marbling.  Boys we are eating good tonight.&quot;
Pulling out a sous vide machine he begins to bring the steaks to that perfect medium rare consistency.
While waiting for them to come up to temperature dad looks around for a side dish.
&quot;POTATOS YES&quot;
While bringing the potatoes to a broil, DAD cuts out a massive slice of Dino-bacon-mean from the stegosaurus and immediately begins to smoke it over applewood.
In a flash the potatoes have been peeled, mashed and mixed with heavy cream provided by a wonderful kow.
Atop the sheet of mashed potatoes lines a fat slab of cheese melted with a blow torch leaving a gooey lower layer with a crisp tasty upper layer.
As the Dino Bacon is completed DAD turns the stove to 500 degrees in preparation for the final sear
After a few moments to cool and reabsorb the juices the Dino bacon gets dices and adorn the top of the cheesy mashed potatoes allowing the dino bacon grease to mix into the soft fluffy potatoes.
DING - the sous vide machine is finished
DAD allows a moment for the meat to cool down before tossing them onto the grill for a final crisp sear on the outside.
&quot;24 plates of heavenly goodness coming up!&quot;</p>
<p>Next to a glass of freshly aquired milk sits a plate adorned with a large serving or cheesy dino-bacon mashed potatoes and a 12 oz tenderloin steak smothered in a sauce of compound butter and rosemary.</p>
<p>Grinning from ear to ear DAD says
&quot;This should blow your socks off. Eat up lads, there is plenty where this came from.&quot;</p>

<p>(note to the world, Dad was totally snacking while making all of this food so he is full atm)</p>

<p>&quot;Eat up, dont be shy. I am looking forward to your review and any bright ideas that arise from it&quot;</p>

<p>The boys all sit down and give thanks. They stare at the meal with furrowed brows. They all pick up utensils and dig in.</p>
<p>Their brows are no longer furrowed. A look of relaxation permeates their faces.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not sure I could have this <em>every</em> day, but...&quot;</p>
<p>Date is in tears.</p>
<p>Fukuhara is also in tears.</p>
<p>&quot;...but damn, that's good.&quot; another finishes.</p>
<p>&quot;That's the spice.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hell yeah.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This would be perfect with a beer.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Real simple with the steak, but incredible flavor. Never had dinosaur meat before but I'm definitely impressed you cooked it so well for what I imagine is your first try... and those potatoes could just kill a man! It's delicious.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Lasht guy shpoke too long. Ish great.&quot; says one with a full mouth.</p>
<p>All of the boys give a thumbs up.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey Goldie, what's your favorite type of food?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It appears the Goldie is uninterested in my steak peace offering&quot; Mr DAD mutters...</p>
<p>&quot;Yo DEKKA DYNOMITE&quot; DAD calls out as he places the 24th plate of steak and potatoes onto a nearby table</p>
<p>&quot;Come eat your fill, Goldie wont be giving us additional information but this should provide ample energy for the this upcoming phase. It should taste great as I've used two secret ingredients from my Earth:  &quot;ground up unicorn horns&quot; and &quot;Love&quot;, and since I couldn't find any fresh unicorns I had to double up on the latter ingredient.&quot;</p>

										</div>										<div class='conversation-post-body'>
<p>A pirate walks into a bar.
That is to say, Captain Soto walks into the strange kitchen and begins to look for alcohol.
&quot;Ye'see, I've had to deal with some seriously bizarre ingredient combinations and food shortages in my time. Had to learn t' cook stuff that'll keep the whole crew passive enough till the storm blows over.&quot;</p>
<p>He begins to pour diluted rum and wine into a medium-sized pan and after a bit of difficulty with the oven, is successfully able to bring the mixture to a boil.
&quot;I've found the more alcohol ye add, the less complaining the scurvy dogs do. Speaking o' scurvy, actually-&quot;
He takes a lemon, pokes a hole into it with his hand, and squeezes most of the thing into the mixture.
&quot;Aye, perfect.&quot;</p>
<p>He then proceeds to cut up some of the trilobites. The alien-looking lifeforms don't seem to put him off one bit.
&quot;Bit of a fish-ey aroma, but reminds me o' home. Actually, the smell is much better than home.&quot;
With the trilobites added, he looks around for some stock, coming across some onions and potatoes. Cutting up the onions proves to be a difficult task, and the occasional <strong>CLANG</strong> is heard as the captain accidently strikes his hooked hand with the knife. For the potatoes, he simply slams his hook against them until they are good and mashed, before adding them to the pot.</p>
<p>&quot;Looks like that be about done-woah!&quot;
Soto stares in amazement at the pepper grinder sitting on one of the countertop.
&quot;This here be fancy stuff,&quot; he remarks as he unscrews the grinder with great difficulty and pours a larger-than-expected chunk of it's contents into his mixture. &quot;You'll be eating well tonight, aye UNIT-13BM?&quot;</p>
<p>Soto waves him over as he waits for his stew to cool, and places a ladel and bowel and spoon close by.
&quot;What you think, eh lad?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sure this would be delicious to any hungry pirate.&quot; The unit grabs the ladel and bowl and scoops some of the stew into its bowl. It then sits in a chair far too small for its size, setting the bowl in front of it. It reaches into the bowl with its long fingers, pulling out a single chunk of dripping trilobite meat. The metal maw on the unit's face drops open unsettlingly wide as it slowly places the meat into its mouth. It chews once, twice... and pulls the shredded piece of trilobite meat out of its mouth, placing it in a conveniently close by trash can.</p>
<p>&quot;I cannot taste, nor can I process this food, but it may have been good. After this, it would be best for you to try what I cooked earler.&quot; https://discord.com/channels/513953894750224397/1170666783494131754/1171063401687031848</p>

<p>One large femur, One small ruby, three fairy wings, a sprinkling of gold powder. Faelorei plucks several items from a disproportionately small pouch attached to her waist and tosses them to the ground near the kitchen before her. The book hovers nearby, seemingly watching her go about this task.</p>
<p>An intricate purple arcane circle forms below, enclosing the random assortment of objects within. The elf girl glides a hand back and forth through the air, glowing blue runes left in its wake. Her other hand flicks each rune, one by one, towards the space above the circle as they begin to swirl about, following its circumference.</p>
<p>With the last of the runes now in this flurry, she reaches out a hand, dipping it into the chaotic. The blue vortex slowly shifts to green as each rune passes through her palm. A blinding white light shines out from the circle's center, quickly devouring the runes in the process before it too is swallowed whole by a burst of smoke.</p>
<p>As the smoke clears, a new figure is found standing inside the arcane circle. One with similar characteristics as another who occupies the ballroom, except for the obvious blue aura being emitted.</p>

<p>Faelorei takes a seat near the kitchen, now clutching her book with both hands as she rocks her legs back and forth. The summoned creature makes its way into the kitchen and begins to grab various tools and utensils, laying them out on a counter near the elf girl.</p>

<p>Öskar curiously oversees the elf girl making preparations for the meal. Some of the ingredients invoke a puzzled and even worried reaction. When a replica of DD is summoned, he looks so stunned that his mask nearly falls of his face. Doesn’t appear this is anything the dragon is used to.</p>
<p>“I volunteer to be the taster of this meal…” He raises his hand like a child in school. “though i have only one request. Please don’t have it be the stego-whatever it is. I am not comfortable consuming a prehistoric reptile… for obvious reasons. The bird would be preferable.”</p>

<p>The large tome wiggles its way out of the elf girl's grasp, toppling over onto a table in front of her. Filling with blue light, it reorients itself rightside up and hovers a few inches up from the surface. It opens its contents for the dragon man to see.</p>

<p>Relief could be heard as Öskar claps his hands together and exhales deeply. “Thank you, Chef Faelorei. I’ll make sure to reserve some portions for you! Seeing a dish prepared by magic should be quite the spectacle!”</p>
<p>He takes a stool and sits at a nearby bar to witness the cooking process.</p>

<p>Faelorei looks to the summoned replica, giving it a short nod before resuming her fidgeting in the chair.</p>
<p>Not-DD grabs for a large dull cleaver and turns to the giant dead bird corpse. With little precision, she hacks and slashes her way at one of the breasts. Blood, guts, and feathers soar through the air as she mangles half of the bird before ending up with dozens of small bite sized chunks of meat. Grabbing for a large bowl, she holds it next to the counter and shovels in the pieces.</p>
<p><strong>CLANK</strong></p>
<p>A large pot rings out as it slams onto a burner before being filled with gallons of undisclosed types of oil. Not-DD grabs two more bowls, filling one with a mixture of flour, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder. In the other, she furiously beats together several pristine terror bird eggs, lining up the bowls next to the now hot pot of oil.</p>
<p>With the assembly line assembled, she throws all of that planning out the window as she dumps everything into one more big container, oil included. Boiling oil overflows, spilling out onto the floor as bubbles burst and erupt. This lasts for several minutes, the horrible concoction brewing inside into who knows what...</p>
<p>...Good thing the wait isn't long as Not-DD dips her hand into the raging oil, grabbing handfuls of golden brown nuggets and plopping them down onto two separate paper takeout containers. She snatches up the two bundles of nuggets and goes to hand one each to Öskar and Faelorei. With a final salute, Not-DD phases out of existence, leaving behind a horrid burning mess in the kitchen.</p>

<p>Faelorei reaches into her seemingly bottomless pouch, grabbing several McDonalds honey mustard packets. She tosses a few over to Öskar as the book gives a confirmation.</p>

										</div>										<div class='conversation-post-body'>
<p>Watching the whole mess unfold made Öskar increasingly wary of what would be concocted as the final product. What was ultimately made, however, was otherwise pretty unassuming. He reads the latest passage on the book and chuckles dryly. “And here <strong>I</strong> thought I was supposed to be the judge. Go figure.”</p>
<p>He takes one of the nuggets and (GASP!) briefly removes his mask to take a bite. Sadly, no one could get a glimpse of his enigmatic mug as he swiftly puts it back on. For a while Öskar chews, and no other action is illicited from the taster. Eventually he gives his verdict. “Solid tenderness. Decently seasoned. The meat itself is… a bit gamey than what I’m used to.”</p>
<p>Noticing the honey mustard packets, he takes one and dips the other half of the nugget inside. Now covered in sauce, the lieutenant finishes the piece and eats again. This time a reaction is caused. His eyes widen like a French critic. He pops more nuggets drenched in sauce into his mouth until his portion is complete. Öskar then gives a secondary verdict. “Perfect! This sauce elevates the meat! Well done, Miss Faelorei! I’d say this dish was a success. Your magic really does work wonders.” He kindly gives the elf girl some gentle headpats.</p>

<p>Faelorei digs into her own nuggets as the dragon man pats her head, seemingly uncaring about the stranger's affectionate contact. Off to the side, however, the floating tome momentarily lights up with pinkish white light. It quickly closes itself, attempting to hide from view until the light dies down.</p>

<p>&quot;Its not every day that I get to cook with exotic foods, I'm going to start making some yummy blue calamari&quot;
Mr DAD puts on some heavy cooking protection gear and begins very carefully filleting a tub of Blue-ringed octopuses. First poking a whole near the beak and then draining this blue ooze into a tightly sealed glass jar.
After tossing the octopuses parts into a mixture of flower and powder the octopuses are carefully placed into a vat of hot oil.<br />
&quot;Oooh what if i get a narwhales horn to skewer the other seafood on. That would be great for a theme.&quot;
Mr DAD leaves for a few minutes in search of the perfect Narwhale horn. Once coming back with his quarry he begins to cut two armlengths skewers for the octopus.
The horns are sharpened and ready to act as a shish-ka-bob, on a cursory glance the craftmanship is quite shoddy. There are several divots/wells where the meat juice would get caught and take away from a lovely fragent slab of meat.
&quot;Oh shit, I FORGOT TO CHECK THE FRYER&quot;
Mr DAD runs back to the oil vat, and to his horror all that is left is charred black pieces of inedible rocks.
Letting out a large sigh, Mr DAD quitely says &quot;Guess I should stick to cooking steak&quot; 😔
He takes off the protective equipment and dons his birthright, a simple white polo and grilling fork.
Those Boys over there seems like they would enjoy a solid steak</p>


<p>(continued in &lt;#1170512482691985458&gt; )</p>

<p>While waiting for the boys to finish eating his steaks Mr DAD gives making blue calamari another go...
Long story short it appears Mr DAD is not adept at making seafood 😦
~~Legend has it Mr DAD is still waiting for the boys to eat steak to this day~~</p>

<p>Cole struts over to the prepared supplies, with a flick of a finger he cuts off the ends of his wraps and in a single smooth pull he removes them completely. The still half-naked man diligently washes his hands and moves on to the ingredients.</p>

<p>&quot;Sick! Thanks.&quot; With a nod and no further delay, Deva picks one of the eggs up with one hand. He moves it around a bit, checking its weight, getting a feel for the thing.</p>
<p>With a single finger flick near its top, a crack that goes almost in a straight circle around the egg forms. Cole removes that top  to reveal the contents of the giant egg: egg. White and yolk as one would expect, there is just a lot of it. He stops to smell the liquid that threatens to overflow for a moment and it just brings a smile to his face. &quot;Good stuff.&quot;</p>
<p>With that, he just tips the thing like a cup and starts drinking the egg's eggy contents, straight from the shell. He throws his head back and doesn't stop until he's had all of it. <em>burp</em></p>
<p>&quot;Good stuff, really good stuff.!&quot; he says. taking the shell and the top he had discarded earlier and throwing it into the trash. The man then takes a big skillet, a bowl, and the rest of the eggs and he parks in front of a stove.</p>
<p>&quot;Best omelet any of you will ever have, better come before I eat both of these.&quot;</p>

<p>The half-naked man starts cooking. He chops the first egg with a single finger, making a crack go on it right in the middle, and with one swift motion he beings it apart in the bowl. using the first fork he could find he beats the contents of the egg together and throws in just enough salt, pepper, sliced chives, and a touch of milk into the mix.</p>
<p>He finds salted butter, which he spreads evenly on the preheated pan. And soon he pours the egg mix into it. As the mix heats up he keeps moving the ends of it, making sure it doesn't stick and that the middle never gets properly solid, in a few seconds he starts slowly folding the ends into the center until half of them are neatly hugging the eggy middle. He then gently throws the thing up to flip it onto its neat, yellow back.</p>
<p>He carefully and gently puts it onto a plate and there you have it, the perfect omelet.</p>
<p>&quot;One more for our other client?&quot; He says, looking at Gil with a questioning look.</p>

<p>His face turns a flush red as he spots the real Cole preparing the omelets. He mutters &quot;I've really got to wear my contacts.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, I appear to have been mistaken, I simply overheard the last bit of dialog and painted the wrong picture!&quot;</p>

<p>Kuro side eyes Gil, nodding to the man as he slides over the first omelet over to himself. Picking up a fork, he takes the first bite. A moment after another, and then another. The young man pauses occasionally to savor the flavor, but even them after only a few minutes the omelet is gone.</p>

<p>With a smile Kuro gives a thumbs up to Cole. &quot;Perfectly done. Back at home, it's rare to get any sort of protein, but even then I haven't had an omelet like this.&quot;</p>

<p>He leans back, looking down at the plate. &quot;Eggs are...pretty rare on my earth. And even then they're mostly farmed illegally. Same with a lot of vegetables and other meat.&quot;</p>

<p>Maximilian looks down from high atop his balcony. &quot;Very well. We appreciate the thought.&quot; He points the rear end of scepter at you, and out extends a comically long set of grabber things, grabbing a hold of a plate, waiting for you to dispense the omelet.</p>

<p>Cole the cook starts working again, he once again breaks the egg with a flick, he once again mixes it with the same things added to it, he once again butters then pan, folds the edges, and repeats the process of making the perfect omelet. At the end, however, he takes a bottle of ketchup and with care, he decorates the final product.</p>
<p>&quot;For giving me a shot at having a challenge.&quot; he delivers the omelet to the grabber and bends his head ever so slightly in genuine gratitude.</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>
<p>Hastar looks towards the dead dinosaurs, his face a mixture of appreciation and a muted sadness.</p>
<p>&quot;I've... never seen one up close. So, these were the creatures that I...&quot; He falls silent. The makeup upon his face looks almost off-putting without a smile. A clothed hand strokes the slain beast.</p>
<p>&quot;Truly, beautiful.&quot; A smile reappears on his face as whatever negative thoughts are pushed down. &quot;So, how do prepare one of you beasties? I've already got a perfect meal in mind.&quot;</p>
<p>Hastar's clothes morph, his skin becomes clearer, his hair grows out and curls. A small little critter appears on his shoulder, ready to provide instruction. His hat splits in three and grows to a proper shape.</p>
<h2>Hastar has taken a new shape.</h2>
<p>&quot;Then, shall we begin the show?&quot; She says, spinning a frying pan in her left hand.</p>

<p>&quot;First -&quot; She pulls out a rubber mallet and half a dozen graham crackers. &quot;I shall beat you to death!&quot; She smacks them all over a countertop, not caring about the mess. &quot;Yes yes DIE DIE DIE! MUAHAHAHAHA!&quot;</p>
<p>The demolished crackers flee in fear, straight into a glass dish. As they attempt to escape up the sides, they're met with the end. While they tried to escape, Hastar had arranged for Mt. Pompeii to explode, drenching the innocent crumbs in a rain of hot, melted butter. Sugar drifts down, like an ash, upon their slaughtered bodies.</p>
<p>&quot;Having not even learned to walk, you ought to crawl, little crumbs.&quot; Hastar sadistically toils their bodies around, flattening them evenly throughout the dish. Not even allowing them to be buried, she puts the dish into the oven, cremating the remains of the bodies.</p>
<p>&quot;Now... which of you wants to sacrifice yourselfs for me?&quot; Her hand finds it's way to a Woolly Mammoth. &quot;You, I recognize. <em>Give it to me.</em>&quot;</p>
<p><em>Drip... drip...</em></p>
<p>She smiles, and walks around the mammoth's table. A bucket full of Mammoth milk awaits her eager eyes. &quot;Good girl.&quot;</p>
<p>Hastar takes the bucket, and snaps her fingers. A circular board, usually reserved for having knives thrown at it, and fashions the bucket to it. With her smaller frame, she gives the wheel a hefty spin and walks away, letting the milk condense.</p>
<p>Ten paces away, Hastar readies knives to throw. She gives the crowd a final wink before the curtains suddenly close.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRD9BqjIk-E">Tunes</a></p>
<p>&quot;Ladies and Gentlemen, Hastar the Star is proud to present - Wooly Will and the Cenozoic Songbirds!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you see, Banana man?&quot;
The curtains fly back open, cream now made and three banana's in Hastar's smiling hands. She takes a bow, then tosses the bananas into the cream. A single taste, her eyes ignite. &quot;Very, very good!&quot;</p>
<p>She dumps the handmade mammoth cream alongwith store bought gelatin into the cracker crust, gives it a wink, and tosses it like a ball into her throwing arm.</p>

<p>&quot;Come one, come any! Who's lookin' to get creampied?&quot;</p>

To all my gorgeous viewers at home, the smell of this creampie is to dream and die for!&quot; Hastar sinisterly licks her lips, prepping her throwing arm and giving the victim a friendly wink.</p>
<p>&quot;Well then my alluring assistant! Are you ready? I won't be taking responsibility!&quot;</p>

<p>Indignation burns in her eyes. To think someone would take this attack so casually!</p>
<p>“Fine, have it your way! It’ll be the last you <em>ever</em> challenge me!”</p>
<p>N4NO could have never predicted it. No one could have. The curtains were closed, the show was already over. There should’ve been no room for a twist. There should’ve been no time, for Hastar to change the script.</p>
<p>“This’ll shut your mouth!”</p>
<p>Moving at lightspeed, it isn’t a Mammoth Creampie that Hastar throws. <strong>It’s three of them.</strong></p>

<p>In a flash, N4NO quickly grabs the three creampies - one in her mouth, the other two in her hands. She shuffles one creampie into her left hand, stacking the two on top of each other, before taking a bite out of the one in her mouth. Chewing methodically, she stands silently for several seconds before saying anything.</p>

<p>&quot;This is quite an eccentric combination of flavors,&quot; she observes, taking a second, delicate bite. &quot;The sweetness of the graham cracker and gelatin mix nicely with the condensed cream, which has a uniquely tangy flavor...&quot; Before you know it, N4NO has already eaten half of the second creampie, seemingly in a blink of an eye. &quot;The flavor of the mammoth isn't exactly gamey, either. It has a flavor I can't quite classify, but it is not entirely unpleasant.&quot;</p>

<p>Approximately a minute later, N4NO finishes her creampies and wipes her face, turning to Hastar and bowing slightly. &quot;Thank you for the sample, it was quite interesting!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We are fairly certain that there is no such thing as gamey milk or cream... at least not from the mammoth milk we provide... surely it exists somewhere out in the immense number of timelines.

<p>This form of Hastar begins to shimmer, starting at her feet and fingers. The creature on her shoulder looks up at it’s master’s face, which holds it’s grateful gaze.</p>
<p>“Good. Good, I’m truly happy.”</p>
<p>Her body begins to break apart, dissolving into rainbow colored petals. Climbing, the dissolution begins to effect the rest of her body, returning this form which accomplished nothing, to nothing.</p>
<p>No, it didn’t accomplish nothing. It couldn’t win. It couldn’t defeat the Mechanical Menace - but it brought a smile, where there was none.</p>
<p>“Fweh, fweh!” The creature on her shoulder fades away, despite doing nothing this whole time.</p>
<p>With one last tearful smile, you can feel Hastar’s unrelenting gratitude, before the petals engulf her face, and she fades away, forever.</p>
<p>“I’m glad… it was you….”</p>
<p>You hear sniffling beside you, Hastar, back in his normal garb, is teardropping water onto his face uncontrollably, hiding his tearful face. “Ooooh…. Hastar what a women you are! Uuuuuu…” His crying becomes muffled out as you’re left, the victor of this bout.</p>

<p>Gil meanders into a cottage-like kitchen with a wood heated stove and iron kettle. Squatting down, he places oak logs into the furnace, lighting a fire. Out of a leather pouch, he produces a variety of different herbs. First a small yellow flower with hallow green stems, dried blue petals deeper than the sky, a small cluster of vibrant red berries, concave yellow petals, and a glass bottle of honey.</p>
<p>Gil places a kettle atop the stove, filled with water.  On slabbed maple countertop, he places a pestle and mortar. Inside are the red berries, plucked from their stems. In reliable practiced motions, he grinds the red berries nearly into a paste. The remaining petals are easily found in a thin mesh, separated from their plants and ready for brewing.</p>
<p><strong><em>fwwwwwweeeeeeeeeeeeeee</em> THE KETTLE SCREAMS, FOR IT IS READY.</strong> Once removed from the stove, 5 minutes pass. Gil lets the water cool. Finally, he pours the water over the mesh into a cup, covering it with a cloth. For the next 15 minutes, the cup does not leave his sight as makes sure it steeps wholly. At which point, he removes the mesh from the cup and adds a spoonful of the red paste and honey are added and stirred for zest and sweetness (his own opinion). The finished product is an earthy brown tea with crimson undertones.</p>
<p>He wafts the drink as his his nose twitches. Satisfied, he smiles. <em>All is right in the world.</em></p>

<p>The monk speaks with a delicately coarse voice. Grinding red berries once again, he tells his tale. &quot;Each petal plucked, separate from their roots, undergoes a remarkable transformation.

<p>He sets the lid and moves it’s <a href="https://youtu.be/kllfICbC7W0?si=_lMYhMX493_c1Zu0">plastic straw up and down</a>, then sips it.</p>
<p>Drinking hot tea from a straw is a really stupid idea so he looks in absolute agony, but he continues drinking.</p>
<p>“Aaaah, refreshing. It is like breathing itself. The flavor, like dirt, has been rinsed away and left with subtle tang of a ginseng root. The texture, like sandpaper, has been smoothed to slide down thy throat with ease. The heat, like a rash, is perfect to warm up the soul.”</p>

<p>He looks down at his unused dried petals and mumbles to himself &quot;So that was called 'ginseng...'&quot;</p>
<p>Looking back up, &quot;Thank you testing for me. Using ingredients I don't recognize usually ends in disaster. I was expecting this to be nothing more than hot leaf juice, but I'm glad it worked out this time.&quot; He picks up his own cup, and peers into it. &quot;Perhaps I will try as well.&quot; With one hand on each outside face of the cup, he lifts it to his face to drink.</p>

<p>Walking in from right behind a corner, though you're confident he wasn't there before, the butler arrives carrying a large platter. It has various cuts of meat. Most of it seems to be a sort of red meat, and included on the platter is a piece of paper illustrating where each cut came from... the dinosaur's flank, its thighs, its gut--even a stegosaur filet mignon. Given the sheer size of a full-grown stegosaur, the cuts are likely only samples, else there would be far too many. Each seems still juicy and fresh, as though straight from a butcher, but with cuts so precise it would be hard to believe a human made them.</p>

<p>With a glint in his eye, Oscar picks out the sirloin cut from the platter. Wordlessly he maneuvers off to his workspace, and preps a stovetop pan and oven.</p>
<p>&quot;A little oil here, some salt there,&quot; while adding the meat to to sizzling pan.</p>
<p>Oscar rummages through his pocket. He holds a coin between his thumb and finger, but amazingly, purple smoke billows out as the coin undulates in his grip. Like grinding out herbs, he softly holds it over the sizzling steaks and seasons it with strange purple mystery dust.</p>
<p>A little more cooking and flipping and he nods in approval. <em>POP!</em> open goes the oven door, and he throws the whole mix in and *WHAM!*s the door back shut.</p>
<p>&quot;Simple and efficient. Can't beat that!&quot;</p>
<p>A few minutes later he pulls the meats out of the oven, and immediately the fragrant, savory aroma fills the kitchen. &quot;5 minutes!&quot; Oscar shouts. &quot;After that time whoever wishes a taste of true dinosaur delicacy can take their fill. With compliments to the chef, <em>naturally</em>!&quot; he smirks.</p>
<p>And with that Oscar leans against a countertop awaiting a taste-tester.</p>

<p>Unable to contain herself as the still sizzling aroma wafts into her nose. Waiting a full 5 minutes was truly the most herlucian task that would be asked of her upon this ship. It would also be the first she fails. Their crimson gleaming eyes fill with stars and a small pool of drool at the tip of their tongue forms.</p>
<p>“Ahhhhh! I’M RUNNING ON EMPTY I CAN’T STAND IT ANYMOOOOOOORE! <strong>CHOMP!</strong>” <em>chew chew</em>, <em>nom nom</em>. She takes the largest cooked cut and tears half of it off with their bare teeth before practically swallowing it whole like a duck. “vvvvvvvvvffffa!” she cheers while smacking her tongue against the roof of her mouth before finishing off the other just as quick. “Sho ghood!” she exclaims, still half swallowing. However despite her enthusiastic praise it was clear the intended portion size was not nearly enough to satisfy the taste tester. Spotting several uncooked cuts, she immediately nabs them before Oscar can even begin seasoning and wolfs them down so effortlessly it calls into question if this girl was even human. “Kinda chewy this way, but way more blood!” She moves on from the prime cuts and starts scarfing up all the junk parts. Eventually not much more is left on the beast from the neck below besides its iconic back plates affixed at the spine. Dekka rips one off and samples that too. CHOMP. A disturbing hearty crunch echoes out in cringeworthy fashion. “Crispy too!”</p>

<p>“Belch!” DD rubs her tum, and finally, it seems their monstrous appetite was sated. Only… to then grow somewhat peckish a few moments later. All that was left was the head. Dekka flattens a palm with her fingers perfectly straight. <em>STAB</em>. The dead dino’s skull is punctuated right through the eye socket and she forcefully rips out a goopy red hunk of meat no bigger than a walnut. She gives the beast one last <em>nom nom</em>, swallows, savors the taste for one moment, aaaand…</p>
<p>👍</p>
<p>She likes it! A-all of it… DD licks the blood off her fingers and gives the chef a kiss, leaving a crimson stamp of approval upon their cheek for the hard work 💋 “You’re a natural at this! Hey! If your Earth gets blowed up or something, wanna come be my personal chef! C’mon we can talk about wages later!”</p>

<p>Oscar is stunned. Fear freezes on his face as Dekka tears into the Stego meat with reckless messy abandon, and in a <em>SNAP</em> the dish is gone.</p>
<p>&quot;No stop, that meat is raw--&quot; is all he can get out before the tornado of Dekka rampages through the other meats, and he's splattered with blood from her chomps. He can't even think to wipe his face. The man's shell-shocked. Scarred for life. Horrified beyond comprehension.</p>
<p>&quot;Th-Thanks... Talk to you later...&quot; is all he can muster at Dekka's kiss of gratitude as he shuffles off the kitchen set.</p>

<p>&quot;While one prepares the meal, the other is then to eat it, and... review it. Tell us how it tastes. The one who eats the meal will then be given information. For those with knowledge of Earth's prehistory, it should come as no surprise that the trilobites will relate to our Paleozoic room, the stegosaur there to the Mesozoic, and that terror bird to the Cenozoic. Other prehistoric animals are available on request.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The information given to the consumer about these rooms will relate to which items can be found in that room. It goes without saying that each cook and consumer only get one shot at this. To reiterate, as it is the nature for one to be on top, <em>only</em> the consumer who reviews the meal will receive information from us. Do with that information as you will.&quot;</p>
<p>Maximilian pauses. &quot;You boys--&quot; he points at The Boys &quot;--may only count as one, either cook or consumer. Also, should all of you wish to participate, as there is an odd number, then for the 17th member I will have my butler cook for you. But that is only if everyone else participates.&quot;</p>
<p>Maximilian returns to his throne, sitting down and taking a sip from his wineglass, not breaking it this time. &quot;You may begin!&quot;</p>

<p>A petite cyborg strolls into the room, her metallic feet softly clanking against the floor. Her neon blue eyes seem to flicker slightly as she scans the surroundings. &quot;Have I been summoned onto a new colonizing ship?&quot; she inquires to no one in particular, her voice soft and slightly robotic. &quot;Though, I do not recall receiving death game protocols...&quot; N4NO's earpieces twitch slightly to one side and she stuffs her small hands into her cardigan pockets, continuing her leisurely stroll. &quot;... curious. Very curious.&quot;</p>

<p>“Domo arigato!!! For all you’ve done for Earth!! Or…” As he approaches he takes out a pair of glasses and slides to a halt, putting a hand to his chin.</p>
<p>“Misses Roboto! Are you completely functional? Of all the times I’ve lived, never have I been to the future!”</p>

<p>”The pinacle of engineering! The future rules! Yeah! Yeah! Rules!” He excitedly hops back and forth, floating a bit with every hop all the while clapping.</p>
<p>But suddenly, he comes to a complete halt, still midair. “Does Canada still exist in the future? Wait, no spoilers! None! Not a single one out of your mouth!”</p>
<p>“Alright you win! Just one! Did the <em>Limbs</em> ever get back together? I still have their first album, footsigned by Big Foot himself! The old coot was wandering around the Dakota’s back in 1923, haven’t heard from him since.”</p>

<p>N4NO chuckles slightly and runs her hand through her hair. &quot;I have never heard of the Limbs. I am assuming they are from your version of Earth?

So prepare yourself! You'll be laughing more and more, enough for your entire species! Welcome to my House of Fun! The name's Hastar, you've never heard of me!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Pah.&quot; Hastar's face actually turns to a frown. How odd.</p>
<p>&quot;Higher entities always get a bit crazy. Raving on about perfection and becoming complete - all nonsense! Talking sense into them is usually a fool's errand, don't bother. Actually...&quot; He chuckles too himself. &quot;Do bother! You can do it!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A perfect universe however... how would that look to you? For me, it'd be a place full of laughter!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Higher entity... do you suggest that our host is not actually a human being?

<p>N4NO rolls her eyes a little at the abundance of robotic-themed puns and chuckles a bit. &quot;I am hardwired to protect the Earth, especially the national parks, with all of their untamed natural systems preserved. I would very much like to return to my team of rangers back home so that they are not overburdened without me.&quot;</p>

<p>He slides a hand over his eyes, down his face. &quot;It's a rather hideous form... I was a child born prematurely and disfigured, it's a sight no one wants to see.&quot; His hand moves away from his eyes, glancing over at the girl. &quot;What kind of entertainer would I be, if the audience could see through my act?!&quot;</p>

<p>N4NO throws her head back slightly and laughs. &quot;Haha! The cyborgs on your world are much different than mine. We have no organic skin, or internal organs, but we are programmed to feel sensitivity on our exostructure much like human skin. We are also capable of experiencing emotion and pain as well. But, we are programmed, each of us a unique artificial intelligence.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am a N4NO unit, programmed to specialize in preserving and researching Earth's national parks in an effort to help make the Earth more hospitable for humans again.&quot;</p>

<p>Benedict reaches into his jacket and pulls out what appears to be a notebook, A quill and and a container full of ink. He sits down on the marble floor and scribbles into his notebook. He looks up at N4NO and speaks.
&quot;What's a national park? The only parks I know from back home are deer parks. Mostly used by the King to hunt Deer for sports.&quot;</p>
<p>Benedict then goes over his notes again and then proclaims.
&quot;I cannot imagine your Earth to be any less hospitable than the rat infested streets of london.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A national park is very similar to a nature preserve,&quot; N4NO explains, her voice taking on a tour-guide tone. &quot;The parks often feature beautiful natural wonders unique to the region they are in, and they are as undisturbed by permanent human settlement as possible.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;London...&quot; N4NO takes a second to ponder, &quot;yes, I have been there before, but briefly. It was densely populated, and severely polluted when I last saw it.&quot;</p>

<p>Benedict Payne catches the eye of Adam Brando from a few dozen feet away. He kicks his heels together and a two way dimensional tear opens up in spacetime between him and Benedict. The two flat planes shatter like glass made of light, exposing an inside of impossible geometry and paradoxical visions. Likely the first thing to catch Benedict's attention would be the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8aAv-m_KmQ">loud music blasting from the portal</a>.</p>
<p>Adam steps through and suddenly appears next to the man muttering to himself. &quot;Frantic frenzy there, friendo. Let me do you a solid. The only apple pies in this neck of the woods are cooked up by Grooviless Mc.Goldilocks over there. And I reckon eating one wont send you back.&quot; He looks over his shoulder and barks, &quot;Buzz off you scrambled shack.&quot; The dimensional tears disappear, along with the music. Adam turns his attention back to Benedict Payne.</p>

<p>Luscious runs surprisingly quickly over to the clown’s performance. He claps his hands together, golden gauntlets loudly CLANGING together.
“A bard! Things were getting a bit dreary around here, how about you sing ‘The Ballad of The Most Handsome and Perfect Knight?’” Luscious climbs onto a nearby table, which buckles and produces an audible groan beneath the knight’s weight.
“I’ll start!” He clears his throat.</p>
<p>“<em>Oh, the great and handsome golden knight,
He impresses us all with incredible might,
Strong and fearless since the cradle,
He defeated a dragon with a ladle!</em>”</p>

<p>”Thank you, thank you all! You’re too kind!” Hastar bows gratefully, flowers raining down upon him.</p>
<p>“I am Hastar! The star of the show! I bring mirth and joy wherever I go! If this place is miserable…” He takes out a long balloon and blows into it, tying off the end.</p>

<p>&quot;A clown.&quot; It approaches Hastar, leaning down to peer extremely closely at his red nose. &quot;Circuses have not been popular for some time in my Earth. Are you from a... circus Earth, perhaps?&quot;</p>

<p>”Your earth must be quite dreadful then!” Hastar bemoans this terrible news. “Though it is not unexpected - if one does not don the makeup, how can anyone be expected to go to their show.”</p>
<p>“Well, I come from a place not to unfamiliar… truth be told…” he leans in close to whisper, but still speaks just as loudly. “Even my world is on the circus decline. They’ve been relegated to the backalleys, the horrid corners of the earth, and the land that not even the moon would shine upon.” It’s possible his description could conjure an image to your mind - one of that forlorn land.</p>

<p>”But! A clown has no need of a circus! I exist to make other’s laugh! Just as you exist to be tall! We all have our purposes!”</p>

<p>”THE DEVA?????!” Hastar’s eyes bludge, even his wine glass grows eyes and stares in shock and awe.</p>
<p>“I’ve never heard of you.” The eyes close and he takes a sip. “I am HASTAR! The star of the show! I’ve gone by many a name, and many more a title. But, when the moon hits your eye, that’s a more.”</p>
<p>“But you, Deva! I’m a huge fan! I loved that time you uh… err, you know. That one time you really did it! Ah it’s right on the tip of my tongue…” Hastar rambles on, hoping someone will assist him in remembering the moment he became a fan of The Deva.</p>

<p>&quot;It should feel great, right? Five times champion- world champion!&quot; He throws his hands out. &quot;Me! Five times! It should've been so good! But the last time was barely a fight, I just kicked into gear when it ended.&quot;</p>

<p>DAD takes a small sip before refocusing onto Hastar
&quot;Quite the contrary, While laugher and the spread of information might have been some of the key design philosophies behind the application its had quicky evolved past its original purpose...&quot;
&quot;The joyous minutes of jolly jokes had taken a back seat as the algorithm pushed more... mindless content. Ranging from the wasting of natural resources to dual videos of overused family guy clips over subway surfers. The content was outrageous but society was willing to overlook this for a time.&quot;
DAD takes another drink before continuing.
&quot;The children were unable to control themselves with this content, 'Just one more video' turned into hours and eventually days of nonstop scrolling as they were desperately attempting to feel any spark of emotion. At the end of it all, all laughter ceased and all that was left were just animated corpse repeating the motions they knew in life.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;On a happier note: the Global DAD program succeeded in freeing most of these individuals from the clutches to TokTik. Those who were once afflicted have been reincorporated into their own families and the feelings of love and laugher proliferate themselves to the farthest corners of my Earth. And as the 23rd Global DAD to serve Earth since the DAD unification, it is my duty to uphold the morality and happiness of all my subjects.&quot;</p>
<p>Upon finishing his glass DAD makes one final remark</p>
<p>&quot;As long as they are all happy, I dont think I can ask for anything more&quot;</p>

<p>”A world without laughter, is no world at all.” Hastar nods in agreement.</p>
<p>“Although… don’t you think that’s wrong?”</p>
<p>He swirls his drink around. “To cut them away from a joke, just because you don’t find it funny? Perhaps what was needed is not a detox, but better content.”</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I agree with you there my new friend. Improving the content was one of the first things we attempted however the algorithm gained a mind of its own. It merely focused on retention rates and click through rates rather than joy laughter and the betterment of society.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Though it is not like we removed laughter and joy from our soceity either! The echoing sound of laughter are still able to be heard today, from babies laughing at funny faces to youths sharing inside jokes between family and friends. The joy that is derived from pure laughter rather than the fake mechanicals imitation is one of the core pieces of our societies foundation&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You seem keen on spreading joy and laughter, is this a core tenet of your creed?&quot;</p>

<p>He smells his drink and takes a single sip, speaking from within the glass. “From my eyes, TokTik does not seem so evil. History is written by the victor, you seem to hold the pen.” He glances at the man’s breastpocket, where a colorful ballpoint pen is now hooked.</p>

<p>&quot;Distractions... yes...&quot; N4NO mumbles, almost to herself, as she idly gazes into the flames in front of her. &quot;I believe such things are one of the key reasons most of humanity has chosen to abandon Earth in my universe. Historians believe they became gradually apathetic and self-absorbed, neglecting their world in the process.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When I was first created and sent off to my first base at Yellowstone National Park, the landscape was incredibly barren and polluted... almost unrecognizable compared to the photographs on souvenir postcards taken merely five years prior.

<p>Oscar strolls up to the scene, quiet as the monk remains still in peacefulness.</p>
<p>&quot;Nice to meet you again, Gil. Do you mind if I sit here? Change of pace sounds good,&quot; he asks.</p>

<p>&quot;Please please, You honor me Oscar. Here, &quot; Gil tosses Oscar an empty cup. &quot;Hold it out.&quot;  Gil once more uses his staff to retrieve and pour a cup of tea. This time, across the fire.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sure today has been unexpected for you. How do you fare?&quot;</p>

<p>Oscar graciously accepts the steaming cup of tea. He takes a sip,</p>
<p>&quot;Mmm. Bitter. Perhaps I'm too used to black coffee to appreciate it, but I'll try.&quot;</p>
<p>Oscar takes a seat across from Gil as he stares into the fire, and his eyebrows furrow in thought. &quot;Today is quite the wild day. Considering my background as a scientist I've always been good at divorcing my emotions from the procedures I need to follow, but...&quot; Oscar trails off.</p>
<p>He takes another hesitant sip. &quot;Well, the reality is that we're kidnapped. Herded onto a spaceship. Played against each other. And worlds at stake. As I sit here it's like the weight finally sinks onto my shoulders.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How do you do it?&quot; he asks. &quot;What do you do to make yourself so serene in a time like this?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I may appear calm, but it is only with years of practice and anticipation that I retain my composure.&quot;</p>
<p>His hand reaches up to check his own pulse. &quot;In truth, my heart races on. My performance has no bearing on the survival of my people, but instead will decide--&quot; Abruptly, he cuts himself off and takes another sip.</p>

<p>He gives a reassuring smile to Oscar, &quot;I should not say more&quot;</p>

<p>Oscar leans forward with a glint in his eye and asks &quot;What do you mean? It sounded interesting, whatever you wanted to share. Well, considering my world and everyone else seems in the same boat with planets at stake, if you have a solution in your hands then I'm eager to hear.&quot;</p>

<p>After careful deliberation, the man speaks again. I can tell you this much: &quot;Since my people live on Mars, once our earth is destroyed we will never be able to interact with the Prosit ship.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Unfortunately, there is no short term solution for the 17 contestants here today. The only thing I can do now is to help my earth survive and buy more time for the scientists of Mars.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Goodness,&quot; replies Oscar. &quot;Interplanetary travel? You're telling me that you've even colonized Mars and have your people living there instead?&quot;</p>
<p>Oscar heaves a deep breath in admiration. &quot;Never would've guessed. Is it lonely enough up there where you can focus yourself in meditation and everything else?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It all happened long before I was born, I really wouldn't do it justice by bragging.&quot; He shakes his head sideways. &quot;There is too much technology in Martian cities, I left that life behind ages ago when I joined the Monastery atop Olympus Mons. I found a much needed simplicity there.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I presume your people reside on earth, yes?&quot; His eyes saunter upwards. &quot;If I may ask, where do your ears originate from? There was an obsession with something <em>just</em> like it during my youth, but it wasn't the real thing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Haha!&quot; Oscar barks out laugh. &quot;These ears? Looks like they're some complication from coming over to this spaceship, some strange happening when Chaos Theory trying to make me fit this environment I'm supposed to gel into. Well, the whole thing's up in smoke since interplanetary travel doesn't exist for us, much less whatever time-space mechanisms instead, which I could spend <em>years</em> investigating if only I had the time and effort, plenty of new equipment...&quot;</p>
<p>Oscar shakes his head. &quot;Sorry. Tend to trail off. To answer your question, years ago my world underwent a massive transformation due to some incidental Chaos Theory experiment. Simply, all humanity is melded together as a giant Earth gas planet. Including yours truly.&quot;</p>
<p>Taking a moment to look himself up and down, he continues &quot;Fascinating... that I'm materialized here so aptly as an accomplished scientist. But despite that, I did not desire fox ears, have no idea where they came from, nor wish to explore that matter further. What a turn of events, wouldn't you agree?&quot;</p>

<p>The monk leans in, though not so close as to be burned by the fire, eyes widening at the part where Earth was turned into a gas giant. &quot;Yes yes, why that is truly intriguing. To think you were but part of a collective gas and now you've come out as a fully formed scientist with wonderous features...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is truly unfortunate however that the Chaos Theory experiment went wrong. Such is the sin of ego.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I wouldn't say it went wrong. It simply <em>is</em>. Of course, life is different for the whole world, and getting to return to this form here on this spaceship is quite the lifetime experience. But! The question is, should humanity reject these advancements, this understanding of Chaos Theory from a new perspective after it's done so much to aid humanity?&quot;</p>
<p>Oscar shakes his head. &quot;I say no! Why it'd be a rejection of my entire lifetime of study! Unless I propel myself headfirst into the field I have no hope of making my mark on history.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, with all that said I would be happy to trade our situation for your world's interplanetary travel. It'd even be worth it for whatever environment allowed a peaceful flower like yourself to bloom, Gil.&quot;</p>

<p>Confident footsteps echo in the hall as a bulky silhouette steadily approaches the hall.</p>
<p>Cole enters with a fist raised high, the only clothing the man has on are his shorts and hand wraps. His skin glistens with sweat and steam from the intense warm-up. A single eye glares through the folds of the towel that rests on his head, as the champion seeks his opponent... An opponent that isn't there.</p>
<p>After a brief pause, the complete lack of clamor, applause, and cheering seems to finally not reach his ears, due to the lack of a crowd, and the absence of an arena. His head snaps up with a startle and the towel falls to the floor as he stares blankly at his fist up above. He brings it down, finally unclenching the massive thing as he looks around.</p>
<p>This is not a fight. He bursts out laughing when the realization hits. &quot;Hahahaha! That's so stupid!&quot;. He reaches down for his towel and wipes the sweat off his face with a sigh. &quot;Got too much into the rhythm.&quot;</p>
<p>He looks down at himself, clad in his battle armor and he mumbles to no one in particular &quot;I should go fix this.&quot;</p>

<p>He continues to waltz, leading them towards a window.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sure you know, I'm quite the showsman, so forgive my soliloquy, I promise, the stage remembers you're here!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A very long time ago, in a land far, far away, there was a grand Kingdom. A place now <em>cursed</em>, to no fault of my own. As the world should be, it was occupied by humans. And wherever humans go, I tend to follow. I love their kind, so full of joy and laughter.&quot;</p>
<p>He slows the waltz, allowing her to take the lead. &quot;But see, this place was no place of mirth. Not when I arrived. Chaos and confusion overthrew the streets, beasts of Old, who dwelled in neighboring stars tore away at the planet. Our earth's differ, but may I presume yours is at least aware of the Old One, or rather creatures of similar origin?&quot;</p>

<p>And so he does, like a ballerina. After, he bows to the lady and extends a single hand, for a faster pace. “Fantastic, then you can calculate the fear that frocked those streets.”</p>
<p>“Truth be told, I hadn’t much interacted with humanity before. They’d always been a curiousity, but one I kept distant. Yet such a ruckus drove me in.”</p>
<p>“Hastar, was not originally my name. As I wandered those streets I was a stranger. Shrieks anoited my presence, as I wore no mask.”</p>
<p>In your hands, paint stains begin to appear. The color is leaving Hastar’s appendages, literally. It’s as if a sheen around him is melting, dripping onto the floor.</p>
<p>“The King of that kingdom, his name was Hastar, yet none had met him. The mere idea of him appearing was maddening, but even further maddening was is absence in a time of dire peril.”</p>
<p>The hand you touch feels like stone, rigid and cold. His face begins to droop, but remains attached by tendrils of some sort of… mucus? Either way, it won’t come off unless someone intentionally takes it off.</p>
<p>“In that place, I remembered my Mother, the moon’s, first and final words to me.”</p>
<h2>Will you remove Hastar’s mask?</h2>

<h2>Hastar has lost it's shape.</h2>
<p>“My purpose was to eliminate all life on earth.”</p>

<p>Crawling out of the gaping hole in the monstrosity’s face, words echoing within a seashell chill the air around them. “And so, in that place, I hated <em>everyone</em>.”</p>
<p>It continues it’s waltz, stumbling now at the unfamiliarity of having deformed feet. “Yet as I took the throne, the funniest of things happened.”</p>
<p>“The people <em>rejoiced.</em> Some people laughed, some people cried. They thanked my arrival, worshipped my arrival, adorned to me a yellow crown.”</p>
<p>The creature becomes more confident in it’s steps, carrying you away in a strange dance. “From that day, I betrayed my mother. I fell in love with humans, their laughter and brittle futures. They swim with dreams big enough to drown them.”</p>
<p>It pauses it’s speech for sometime, silently dancing to the music. “The tall, purple one. The machine. The <em>other</em> machine. The one who sabotaged you - I disagreed with something I heard him mutter before.”</p>
<p>“He called your form <em>revolting</em>. I cannot disagree more, and I find no humor in his remark. I’m brought great pleasure to see that even in the future, when humanity has reached out unto the stars, they still hold those egos of theirs, and fashion their magnum opus after themselves. You are the pinnacle of that species spectacle. As their most enamored audience member,”</p>
<p>The waltz is coming to an end, a stifled applause awaits as the audience sits in silence. “I find you quite beautiful. You, the conceited accumulation of all humanity’s ego and knowledge.”</p>
<p>“So, darling daughter of Humanity, shall I save your world?”</p>

<p>N4NO stands still, temporarily stunned, as she stares at Hastar's true form. &quot;Thank you... you have been a most pleasing companion in the short time we have been acquainted. Your story is moving, as you have adapted within the harshest conditions, and evolved into a remarkable being. I am humbled by you.&quot;</p>

<p>She slowly reaches out and gives Hastar something resembling an embrace. &quot;It should not be my world you save, but your own. If both of ours survive this, that would be the optimal outcome.&quot;</p>

<p>Faelorei quickly glances around at the others in the ballroom, her eyes inspecting each and every occupant while the large tome hovered nearby encased in a deep red glow. She turns to Maximilian last and holds her gaze for a few seconds before returning to the small note grasped tightly in her hands. Many moments pass as the elf girl stands staring at this unassuming piece of paper. Eventually the tome's crimson aura wanes, replaced with the familiar blue glow.</p>
<p>Suddenly the light surrounding them is snuffed out.</p>
<p><strong>BSSSHHOOOOOOM</strong></p>
<p>A loud noise echoes throughout the hall akin to some large electrical apparatus shutting down. It drones on for several seconds before going silent.</p>
<p><strong>CLICK</strong></p>
<p>A single light from up above flickers back to life with Faelorei in its center still holding the note. High above her floats the tome with its contents open to the room below. Rather than casting a shadow down upon the floor, the light pours right on through.</p>
<p>Purple and green characters slowly etch themselves onto the blank pages. The piercing light appears to grant them life. As words are formed, the characters dance from the pages and grow, becoming clear and visible to any onlookers. Much like the tome, they float in the air above the elf girl.</p>

Lush green grass springs up from a dirt floor. Numerous oaks and beeches rise up even higher. In the center stands a small green wooden cottage. Familiar to all, however, a small elf girl stands before the house on a stony walkway. She peers out into the wilderness beyond the scene with one hand clasped around the large tome.</p>
<p>The floating text above fades away as something new takes its place.</p>

<p>The dragonkin glares at his unwelcome neighbor, but offering catches his interest. He takes a small handful to taste, lifting his mask for the snack to reach his mouth.

<p>Another <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K9XZer0TVs"><strong>SNAP</strong></a> shoots out as the scene shifts again. The dirt and grass of outdoors replaced now by the wooden interior of a small kitchen. A table lay offset a bit from the center along with a single chair nestled beside it. Wooden cupboards and cabinets hug the walls occupied by ill-matching tableware. Slabs of smooth stone make up the countertop, separated at one point by a wash basin filled to the brim with dirty dishes.</p>
<p>Faelorei sits atop the lone chair with a glass in hand. The book lays closed on the table's surface while balls of light race about the room.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K9XZer0TVs"><strong>SNAP!</strong></a>. The scene changes once more. A large, dark chamber fills the stage. Skeletal remains of fallen explorers and shadowy horrors alike litter the ground. The light shining from up above funnels through the few cracks in the craggy exterior to illuminate a lone pedestal. Atop it sits a dusty old tome much like the one in the elf girl's possession.</p>
<p>Speaking of... racing down the ancient steps of the chamber is Faelorei with her own tome in tow. Her feet crunch against the brittle bones as she makes her way to the long awaited prize. Snatching the book for herself, earth beneath begins to quake. As fast as her little elven legs could carry her, she leaves the way she came with haste.</p>


<p>Escaping the ruins, another <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K9XZer0TVs"><strong>SNAP!</strong></a> rings out with a change in scene. Returning to the cozy cottage, a short entryway gives way to a living room and even further still to a study. Some stained plates and half filled cups sit on odd surfaces. Old shirts rest on the floor while socks hang over a table's corner. The rustling of a small paper bag reveals a friendly rat eeking out the remaining crumbs yet to be devoured.</p>
<p>The bulk of these rooms, however, are covered in mountains upon mountains of books. Some old, some new. All placed haphazardly on top of each other. Narrow paths through the twisting literary towers of knowledge exist to connect the rooms.</p>
<p>The elf girl carries a stack tomes with her, the companion on top. Her view is blocked, relying on instinct to navigate the maze. A slight bump causes a pile to sway momentarily, but calm sets in before disaster strikes.</p>


<p>A final <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K9XZer0TVs"><strong>SNAP</strong></a> signals the last scene. No fields of green, no dank dark cave, no cozy little cottage home. All that fills the spotlight now is Faelorei clutching a small note in her hands. She stares off into the dark abyss alone, not even her trusty tome by her side. Only silence fills the air.</p>


<p>A large red blade appears in the darkness. Without warning, it swings its full weight towards her.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWaQj0RrVxQ"><strong>FWOOOSH!</strong></a></p>



<p>The elf's head drops to the floor. The body follows after, drooping down to its knees before crashing down on its side.</p>
<p>The note once held in her grasp flitters in the air momentarily, <strong>defenseless against any hand that might reach out from beyond the veil and snatch the secrets within</strong>.</p>

<p>Alarmed by the disturbing sequence, Öskar flies over to the lifeless body of Faelorei. He inspects the corpse(?) and desperately looks around for something to revive her. There’s the envelope. A moments hesitation stops the dragon from snooping. However, out of desperation for answers, Öskar opens the contents.</p>

<p>As Öskar grabs the letter and reveals unto him the secrets within, the scene goes dark. The once penetrating light from up above disappears in an instant. True silence fills the surroundings before the ballroom's natural light finally returns.</p>
<p>The large tome no longer floating in the air now rests on the chest of the lifeless decapitated corpse of Faelorei. Blue arcane energy begins to envelope them both as the headless body slowly stirs back to life. It floats upwards, grabbing onto the book as it reorients itself back to its feet.</p>
<p>With a free hand, it inscribes three runic symbols in the air that also become encased in a blue aura. It taps one, shifting its color to green as any blood spilt is siphoned back with the head and neck cavities. With a second rune activated, the head returns from whence it came. An invisible force appears to sew the flesh together, creating a seamless connection between the elf girl's body and head.</p>
<p>Finally the last rune is touched, its green glow painting Faelorei's face as she springs back to life. Her eyes shift between the dragonkin and DADly figures before her. For a brief moment, they lock in on the letter Öskar holds before giving a spin to eye the rest of the spectating cast. She gives a deep bow towards the two near her as the tome slips out to open its pages once again.</p>

<p>“Thank you! Thank you! Thank you soooo muuuuch!” She did the rounds giving everyone a big hug till…</p>
<p>***“EEEEEK!!! HASTAR NOOO!!!! NO GLITTER!!!! HIIYAAAAA!!!!!!” ***</p>
<p>In an instant DD, the cake, the guests, EVERYTHING, was CAKED in GLITTER.</p>

<p>DAD pats her back, &quot;Its ok, just keep blinking while holding your lids open. That should get most of the glitter out&quot;</p>
<p>DAD shoots a glare towards the guilty glitter bomber and continues. &quot;So Dekka, what would you like for your birthday? While the night is almost up we could get almost anything you want from this ship!&quot;</p>

<p>Suddenly back in the main room, Gil looks up at Max. Relaxed, Gil pulls the note out of his shirt pocket. <em>He has no secrets.</em></p>
<p>But as he opens the note and bears witness to its contents, he turns white. Pale enough to have become a ghost, not just see one. Frozen, his glass falls out of his hands. A distinctive crack and shatter fills the room.</p>

<p>Perhaps the excitement of having not one, but two men ( Adam Brando  Öskar the Ready ) ask for her hand in a dance got to her. When Adam approaches, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/hbNMb0b.jpg">her blade sings a silent song of death as she unsheaths it.</a></p>
<p><em><strong>SLICE</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>click</strong></em></p>
<p>She cuts the two men down so fast they are unable to see. Two halves of a letter flutter in the air and drift down to each dance partner. They read as follows.</p>
<p>||”I will not allow DD to return to our Earth”||</p>
<p>And the second piece</p>
<p>||”Anyone that stands in my way shall be vanquished”||</p>

<p>Adam doesn't seem perturbed in the slightest he and the letter are cut down. Where he's been sliced a tear in spacetime appears with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8aAv-m_KmQ">usual ominous blaring music</a> emanating from it. Over several seconds his body is repaired while his eyes nonchalantly following the fluttering cut letter as it drifts to the ground. At no point does he even express any pain.</p>

<p>Adam opens up his envelope, takes out the note, and stares at it for many seconds. His gaze for a brief moment flits from person to person before finally returning to the paper in his hand. The man is perplexed, yet... amused?</p>
<p>He looks up and sees DEKKA DYNOMITE and Öskar the Ready dancing. The man lets out a dry laugh. &quot;Looks like I'm cruisin' for a snoozin'.&quot; A flick of the finger sends a hole in spacetime tumbling down like a deck of cards that shatter into thousands of pieces of light. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8aAv-m_KmQ">usual music blares</a> in stark contrast to Max's classical as he steps through. Seconds later he walks back in with an even snazzier suit along with a pair of sunglasses. The champagne glass he once held is now two golden goblets.</p>
<p>A sudden spark of realization hits just as his foot crosses the barrier back into the ship. He hobbles back a bit and seems to pull a massive, completely out of place crimson and gold throne through the portal with just his foot while not spilling the contents of either drink. &quot;Hey, widen up, pal.&quot; He barks as the tear widens to accommodate the large seat.</p>
<p>&quot;Forty days and nights with you...&quot; He grumbles as the dimensional passage crumbles into nothing and the music along with it. &quot;Now where was I?&quot; Adam sits and places both goblets on the armrests of the large still out of place throne. He pulls the note out from his back pocket and reads over it again, though his attention is quickly taken by the dance floor. &quot;Lotta moves, but not a lot of movin'.&quot;</p>
<p>Adam calls out to Oskar, &quot;Oi, Little Foot. As entertaining as it was to watch you guide a celestial body to this serenade of seniors fucking, how 'bout you help get this show on the road and point me in the direction of that lovely lady you had back there?&quot; He reaches for the goblet to his right and takes a slow sip of its wine.</p>

&quot;Just one more day... This music reminds me of GrandDADs taste of music&quot;</p>
<p>Taking out a small relic of the past an AndroidPod Mini and a portable bluetooth speaker DAD fiddles with it for a moment before it spits out &quot;BLUE TOOTH PAIRING MODE ACTIVE BEEP BEEP&quot;. A moment later and the classical music has a contemporary counterpart filling the room.</p>

<p>&quot;You know Dekka, I'm glad your my dance partner in this event. It makes what I'm about to say a bit easier&quot; DAD takes a deep breath and continues
&quot;While I am titled Mr. DAD on my Earth, I never had offspring of my own and all the faces of the kids and other citizens I interacted with all muddle together. Splitting my attention across billions of people each day I never had time to build any meaningful relationships with anyone. And when my final term as DAD was to come to a close, the people I worked for/with planning on sending me into an enteral slumber with a few pieces of candied lead.&quot;</p>
<p>DAD glances towards the golden creature atop the stairs &quot;While this Death game is a terrible use of resources and a horror to all involved, I am grateful for being able to meet everyone here (+/- goldie 🤮).&quot;</p>
<p>Taking great joy in something he has never been able to do on his Earth, DAD turns his <em>full</em> attention back to DD. &quot;Dekka, spending time with you has been an absolute joy these past day. You're creative, caring, thoughtful and a bundle of chaotic joy. I know that you don't have parents left on your Earth, but if you would be willing to accept the title as my Daughter... that would mean the world to this old DAD.&quot;</p>

<p><em>“Daughter…???”</em></p>
<p>The word almost seemed foreign to her, perhaps she didn’t understand. As tears start to well up in her eyes, it became quite clear she did.</p>
<p><em><strong>“Yes! Of course Dad!”</strong></em> Dekka stops her dancing to squeeze the life out of DAD with a massive bear hug. Due to her superhuman strength, she might actually end him right here too!</p>
<p>“You’re the best! Seriously! The absolute best! It feels like… meeting someone from your dreams that was always meant to be a part of your life, becomes real…”</p>

<p>“So yes! I’ll happily accept! Thank you so much, Dad!” Overcome with so much joy, she hugs her Dad again, forgetting about the letter on her person entirely.</p>

<p>&quot;Its OK Dekka I understand... its probably something super important!&quot; DAD says in a bit of a stupor.</p>
<p>Coming to his senses a brief moment later he notices the letter and picks it up.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh man...&quot; He mumbles &quot;this simply just wont do...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hey Maximilian, Im going to borrow your kitchen again. K thx&quot; and DAD heads off back to the dinosaur slaughter house</p>

<p>DAD can be heard swearing at the prosit printer in one of the adjacent rooms
&quot;WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU ARE OUT OF COLOR INK. I JUST FILLED YOU UP&quot;
<em>THUNK.... Printer working noises</em></p>

<p>Rushing out of the printer room with a stack of papers, DAD doesn't notice one of his <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1172914704843284572/1172914895281475656/Dekka_Bday_card.png?ex=65620d1e&amp;is=654f981e&amp;hm=38508e50ccd985245aa7dcf3044b1e76b6083e2a33119002654ca84af6fd7847&amp;">flyers fall to the ground face down</a></p>

<p>The unit stands tall, shoulders high above the crowd on the dance floor, its black suit framing its blank, white face like a tall, lonely mountaintop.</p>
<p>It looks at the envelope in its hand, slowly taking the small note out. It stares at it for a moment, unmoving, before looking back up as it crushes the paper in its hand. &quot;Perhaps they think themselves psychoanalysts. How crude.&quot; Its hollowed voice is bitter and hard.</p>
<p>After a long moment of stone-still deliberation, it speaks. &quot;I cannot dance.&quot; It promptly leaves the dance floor for a moment before returning with a string of yarn. &quot;I have never performed for another before. I hope this will be sufficient to 'satisfy' them.&quot;</p>

<p>Eventually the dragonkin sighs with a hint of restlessness. He takes a more assertive approach and holds MoMo’s hands in their proper positions. Öskar then he takes control while slowly dancing with the car lady.</p>
<p>“See? This is fun isn’t it?” He rhetorically asks MoMo. “I learned to crudely dance at a royal ball once. Took many attempts, and got heckled mercilessly by colleagues as I as just a Private back then. Yet… those were some fun memories nonetheless.”</p>

<p>MoMo at the very least appears limber enough to follow the steps, though from the expression worn on her face…</p>
<p>“....”</p>
<p>It seemed she was unimpressed with either the steps or idle chatter. The enigmatic figure follows along, almost begrudgingly, but nothing about themselves is shared beyond them clearly not being human. The letter remains tightly clutched in their possession all the while.</p>

<p>&quot;Alright fine, I shall help craft a story for our deceased friend&quot;</p>
<p>DAD takes a moment to ponder</p>
<pre><code>During one of the dinosaur ages Kujo ran into a fresh T-rex hatchling who was crying. Rather than looking for four items Kujo took it upon himself to deliver this creature back to its family.  So he took out his motorcycle and began riding around with the hatchling.  Thats when the earth began to shake and tremble. 
'I should get to the high ground to see whats going on.  The high ground did wonders for that one jedi' 
And as he was cresting over the top of the volcanic mountian it erupted showering him and the hatchling in a hellfire of molten rock
</code></pre>
<p>&quot;And thats the story of how Kujo left the realm of the living. The End&quot;</p>

<p>But Oscar stops in his tracks as suddenly, where there certainly existed a wall before, a bar spreads out before their eyes. There's a row of spirits on display, alongside a wide counter with plenty of stools, all glitzed up with the decor of the ballroom.</p>
<p>&quot;Three cheers! What the hell. Now what's the selection, what's the selection,&quot; as he steps behind the unmanned counter and rummages through some bottles.</p>

<p>A shape moves beside the bar, a tip tap of a dress shoe kicks against the bar's wooden counter, alerting Oscar of it's presence.</p>
<h2>Hastar has taken a new shape.</h2>
<p>&quot;Excuuuse me sir, but could you keep the dumpster diving for the <em>dumpster</em>...? This place isn't quite a trash heap.... yet....&quot; A dreary voice mumbles some complaints at her customer's rudeness, muffled indignation by the pure sleepiness of working 4 15 hour shifts in a row. The slovenly blue collar woman moves her hand towards a red button beneath the counter, while her other stifles a yawn.</p>

<p>He wipes his mouth and continues &quot;In case you're not intentionally blockheaded, I graduated Stanford for scientific fields involving the application and use of Chaos Theory in potentially unravelling reality itself, much less the offshoots of findings into physics, biology, celestial fields and so much more. Not for drink mixing. But,&quot; he shrugs, &quot;if you're not just lying through your teeth then at least you own something of a living. Respectable at least.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;See, if you want to make anything of yourself in life you need to leave your name in a history book. When I was a boy I was nothing, and if I let myself stay the path I was born into I would have <em>stayed</em> a nothing, which so many people do. Not me! Not by pretending to be someone I'm not! When people want that success but they're not willing to bust their ass for it, and you see who stands on top of the world and who doesn't, it makes life real simple. If I have to craft some mask like you to reach the winner's circle then what the hell's the point. Who will remember you, Hastar, instead of whatever...&quot; he gestures at your general direction, &quot;... version of you you're dressing up as?&quot;</p>
<p>Pinching the bridge of his nose, he moans &quot;Ugh I'm already spilling my guts. How's that drink coming along.&quot;</p>

<p>He gazes over Hastar again. &quot;So when you're disguised like you are... hmmmmm,&quot; as he ponders the possibilities. &quot;Is it magic? Not the stage kind, the mystical fantasy sort of transforming against all rules of physics that this ship seems to be full of.

<p>&quot;But really, I'd like to know what runs through that head of yours with you being you. Locking something up under 50 layers doesn't make something valuable; usually, things become valuable being shown off to the world. If you want to be a celebrated figure, then eventually, you need a celebrity persona people can stick a picture to for the one they call Hastar, don't you see?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Dear oh dear. This alcohol's getting to me. And that,&quot; as he pushes off the counter, &quot;is enough for sensible minds.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We may have our differences... you with your big red nose and me with my pristine flesh nub... but I just wanted to let you know before shit hits the fan tonight that you have my respect. You've found the purpose to your long ago and have been living to fulfil it.  Up until tonight I have been running around fulfilling the duty set out in front of me...&quot;</p>

<p>”I don’t think we’re all that different - Dear old Dad!” He pulls from his robe a mirror and spins it around. The mirror has a red nose and clown hair drawn onto it. “See! Not that different at all.”</p>
<p>The mirror vanishes at an impossibly fast speed, as Hastar sends the robe billow around him. “You say you’ve found your purpose, that is good, very good, human! You’ve done it far quicker than I had managed…”</p>
<p>He begins to dance down the stairs. “No! I had a purpose from the beginning, one I came to reject. What one “needs” to do, versus what they “want”… such things I leave to historians to detail!”</p>
<p>Tip tap. Hastar finishes his stride directly infront of Dad, looking up in glee. “Are you to save your world, human?”</p>

<p>Luscious sits on an empty bench, sword planted firmly on the ground. He is leaning on it, almost putting his entire weight on the weapon. The knight looks worse for wear. Somehow, his armour does not seem to be as golden as the first time he introduced himself; the metal looks dull, no longer reflecting very much light at all. The sword’s hairline fracture has become a spiderweb of cracks running along the blade. It seems almost counter intuitive that it is still in one piece.</p>
<p>Luscious is slumped, no longer oozing confidence and energy. There’s a rasp in his breath that was not there before. His piercing blue eyes, however, are still as vibrant as ever. They track the movement of people in the common room.</p>

<p>The strumming of a lyre anoints the arrival of a bard, his vocal chords already readied and firing away at a mournful song.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Ooooh, our brave and golden knight,</em>
<em>He once shone through the night,</em>
<em>His fears and meres, brought to light,</em>
<em>Now quivering and weary,</em>
<em>He appears so dreary,</em>
<em>Even a tad queery.</em>
<em>His might was fulgor,</em>
<em>But now he's so vulgar,</em>
<em>And smells of pungent sulfur,</em>
<em>Our once, mighty kniiiiight...</em>&quot;</p>
<p>The song trails off, met not with uproarous cheers, but rather jeers and the muffled crying of the audience. Hastar himself drips water onto his face, bemoaning the death of a hero.</p>

<p>Luscious stands up, and, despite his slight slouch, towers over the clown. He leans forward, almost uncomfortably close. He stays like that, for a few seconds, before he speaks.</p>
<p>“I have a poem of my own, bard. Would you like to hear it?” Luscious doesn’t wait for an answer before he begins to whisper, leaning even closer, almost touching the clown’s ear.</p>
<p>The poem is unintelligible to all but Hastar, but Luscious’ murmurs somehow permeate across the room. The sound is reminiscent of rustling paper and folded cloth, and it is uncomfortable to hear. Once his recital concludes, Luscious stands up straight again.</p>
<p>“Well? Any constructive criticism?”</p>

<p>Mr DAD approaches with a his champaign glass sporting a new suit and tie. Where his old tie was yellowish-gold with black stripes, this tie had replaced all the yellow in favor of a more classy silver.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey Champ, you dont look too good mate. Whats up?&quot;</p>
<p>Taking a seat next to the champion of light, DAD looks up and down his armor.</p>
<p>&quot;I like the new look, Gold was always an overused color&quot; he said while shooting a sideways glance towards the architect</p>

<p>Luscious looks up at Mr. Dad and lifts a gauntleted hand up in acknowledgment. “Apologies for my less than savoury appearance, friend.” His voice is rough and subdued, a sharp contrast from the boisterous well-spoken man he had been just a day ago. “My power is tied to my kingdom. I have never been this far from it, and as such I am… weaker.”</p>
<p>Luscious stands, his armour creaking loudly. “Nevertheless, I appreciate your words of comfort. Fear not, I am still mighty. Is there anything I may assist you in? I am always happy to help a senior citizen”</p>

<p>DAD takes a sip of champaign and raises his glass towards Maximilian
Slightly slurring his words he announces &quot;PROSHIT&quot; before gently placing his glass on the floor.</p>

<p>Öskar the Ready couldn’t be any less miserable in his current state. His jet-black, gnarly armor has been replaced with a flashy, violet tuxedo. The trademark mask was still on his face however. Surprisingly this suit accommodated for his wings and tail. Despite this the dragonkin continued to sulk, and it appeared he was shivering.</p>
<p>“T-t-this is shameful! To have my proud armor s-stripped from me and be c-confined to these… tacky sape clothes!” He fusses indignantly while clutching his own arms. “And that excursion, what a n-n-nightmare! That ice and snow could’ve s-sent me into shock! Surely there should be a h-hot spring to rejuvenate myself.” Öskar begins to stiffly wander about in search of one. Clearly the suit is affecting his movement.</p>

<p>Standing close to the exit to the room, Kuro waits with his hands in his pockets. His bulky clothing and equipment have been replaced with a slightly casual dress jacket and shirt combination with black pants. A slight glow from his pocket does reveal, however, that he still wears his right glove. His hair also appears to have been stylized and is no longer unkept.</p>
<p>&quot;This is messed up...&quot; Kuro looks up towards the ceiling and then sighs as he closes his eyes, shaking his head as he stands there in silence.</p>

Taking a look around and seeing everyone else copying his fancy dad atire a stupidly large grin begins to spread across his face.
&quot;Now... This is epic.&quot;</p>
<p>He steps out of the main room for just a moment and returns with a few gloves and a baseball.  Leaning against the lone oak tree in the room, Mr DAD seems open for a game of catch or a good conversation.</p>

<p>Sorta absent mindedly tossing a ball up and down. &quot;You could say I am a fan, catch was always a simple activity that I could use to get my mind off things.  Well in theory, I was never able to give it my full attention...  Fancy a game?&quot;</p>

<p>The man laughs, and as the baseball approaches Oscar catches it close to his chest with both hands.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, in elementary school there was another Oscar I had to share my name with. Of course, it's something no one could've helped, but all the same it annoyed me to no end back then that someone was stepping on my territory. When you're a child every problem seems magnified tenfold.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Speaking of names, if I may ask, what's the story behind yours? But let me guess,&quot; says Oscar as he tosses the ball up a few times to gauge its size. &quot;An initial? Something like your full name being 'Daniel Alec Darwin', or something like that?&quot;</p>
<p>He throws the ball back, a little too high.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh man, I'm not as nimble as I used to be.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Daniel Alec Darwin huh, that doesn't sound half bad.  You see, I wasn't given a name when I was younger, just a numbered item in a training batch.  DAD is a title I had to earn its kinda like the Prime President title the American States United used back when they were still a super power.  Perhaps your earth had something similar.&quot;</p>

He send the hurtling towards Oscar with <em>slightly</em> more force than he was planning on using.</p>

<p>&quot;Grah!&quot; Oscar tries catching the ball in the chest like before, but bungles the catch as the ball bounces off his chest shoulder. He walks over to pick it up while talking.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, congratulations for earning that DAD title. Quite a bit of your world seems drastically different from mine, but titles and accolades can't ever be disputed of your worth.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As for me and Chaos Theory,&quot; he gesticulates with his hands, &quot;To explain at its basic terms, have you ever heard the phrase 'The flap of a butterfly's wings can create a hurricane on the other side of the planet'? That's the focus.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Scientists know how things should work. After all, it's a central tenet that scientific discoveries must be repeatable to reach the same conclusions, but of course some things cannot be controlled: the air pressure could be off, the temperature could be different, or even the atoms involved could be disarrayed. All of which sound manipulative by inconsequential degrees, but just like the butterfly's wings, can lead to catastrophic changes much later.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You follow so far?&quot; asks Oscar as he throws the ball back. It's an underhanded throw, easy up in the air.</p>

<p>&quot;Never been much a fan of dogs, to be honest.

<p>&quot;My ideal world, huh...&quot; Oscar stands in place as he tackles the question.</p>
<p>&quot;Never thought of it much. Sure, I'd always wanted to change the world, unlock all its mysteries through scientific breakthrough, applying Chaos Theory to solve all of humanity's ills, the same daydreams every scientist has. But there was never an ending in place; when technology outpaces humanity's vision, there's no point imagining the society of the future.&quot;</p>
<p>While pondering, Oscar pulls at some of the glove's seams absentmindedly.</p>
<p>&quot;I... want a world where all people can work together. Everyone can become part of something greater to accomplish so much more than fighting amongst themselves. Where everyone has their place contributing to society, and the fruits can be enjoyed by everyone. Solving physics equations? Easy. Solving human conflicts? Impossible. Wish it wasn't.&quot;</p>
<p>Oscar releases the tension in his shoulders, saying &quot;Call it an immature dream if you want, but that's my vision.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What about you Mr. DAD? Surely you give it plenty of thought.&quot;</p>

Unlike DD, this woman’s eyes did not gleam crimson. Only a slight shimmering not her own from the blue Earth could be seen in these cold slate saucers.</p>
<p>Her icy pale gaze scans over the present Hastar, Oskar, Kuro and the other various men in need of a suitor to dance.</p>

<p>Fluttering over to another side of the room, Öskar greets the solitary woman with a wave. “Ah, hello Queen Dekka. Nice new outfit you…” He stops mid sentence and inspects the now unfamiliar person in front of him. “You’re not DD. Who are you? And where’s… wait a minute.”</p>
<p>The dragon’s eyes widen a bit as the realization comes to him. “Is that you, MoMo? I wasn’t aware you could have a body. Your versatile functionality never ceases to impress. I wonder why you’re here on your own with no DD though.” He takes notice of MoMo’s cold stare, nodding sympathetically. “Not one for crowds, are you? I’m similar. Really just depends on the <em>type</em> of crowd that gives me pause.”</p>

<p>A familiarly huge tower of metal and mechanisms stands in the room, as unmoving as ever. This time, it wears a spiffy, black suit, fitted exactly to its impossible proportions. It holds a champagne glass, but it promptly puts it down at a table.</p>

<p>&quot;I have not worn an outfit in many, many years. It is not a feeling I am used to, but it is well-fitted, at least. As I am now, I am not uncomfortable tearing or removing it if need be. I was not designed to require clothes.&quot;</p>

<p>The hall which housed them all was so vast, so impossibly large, that if one were to walk from one end to the other by foot? They’d likely find themselves marooned out in the middle of a dry arid desert with nothing but hot dusty bleakness for as far as the eye could see.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOtcVWWL1gA">The hot cut of a knife stings the ears as a burning guitar shreds faintly over the desert.</a> Faint strumming quickly turns to a deafening boom as the fabric of space time rips open from a black hole no larger than 300 meters wide. A massive yellow space truck with blue flames splashed against its paint job emerges, moving at speeds so high, not even the black hole could contain its form or light. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/qYbCjiC.png">Atop stood Dekka with her arms crossed and in a cowgirl getup complete with weapons holstered at the hips.</a></p>
<p>A flurry of lasers and explosions soon follow in their wake, however. Affixed to MoMo’s tow was a long line of 17 space shipping containers, likely loaded to the brim with treasures or contraband, with the way the combined might of the space pirates &amp; space forces hauling after them gave pursuit. The tear in space and time soon collapses in on them just as the 17th wagon clears the gap and the gas tank hits empty.</p>
<p>Two tie fighters manage to come screeching out after them but <em>quick draw Dekka</em> takes them out with two precisely placed shots, causing a cool EXPLOSION behind her as she turns to the others.</p>
<p>“Wooo!!! Haha! Miss me guys?” She winks and tosses a bundle of a dozen or more space crowbars to the floor and rejoices. “Check it! Managed to nab a couple of loot boxes from those space dweebs! C’mon everyone! Let’s crack 'em open and see what we get!” DD seemed to be mistaking basic space shipping containers for gachapon boxes, but nevertheless…</p>
<p><strong>17 rolls for 16 champions. Care to try your luck?</strong></p>

<p>Dekka shows that her samurai gun gal look ain’t just for show. With a quick unsheath of her katana and a hipfire of her space blaster, DD is able to turn her back to the crate in a epic pose as she holsters her weapons and the doors fall right off the hinges.</p>

<p>DD kicks the glass and it rattles off the hard steel walls of the crate, but does not shatter. As it tips upright once more however, they can both clearly see the glass is still full.</p>

<p>DAD thought he was going for number 2 but when the crate cracks open it is clearly labeled <strong>9</strong></p>
<p>“Woah!” Dekka exclaims “Not a bad roll, Dad!” by the odds it was completely mid.</p>
<p>An avalanche of space minerals and other various deposits tumble out and bury them both waist deep. “BLECK!” DD worms her way up out of the pit of rocks and coughs a bit. “You won uh… a bunch of rocks? The heck were they haulin’ this around for??” These space minerals may fetch a hefty price somewhere, or even serve as some choice crafting materials, but DD was almost full on dejected by the roll.</p>
<p>“Oh!” something glimmering catches her eye and she dives back in. A minor hazard of raining rocks occurs as she tosses them recklessly out of the way. Eventually she springs back up to the surface like a seal, biting something hard n’ shiny in her mouth. “Phooy!” She spits out what looks to be some sparkling gemstone. A pale but deep turquoise hue, when held in the light it shimmers as if there were a sea of stars inside. “So pretty~ Can I keep it? Thanks DAD!”</p>

<p>&quot;I BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF DINOSAURS!&quot; He yells, at the hall room clearly excited. &quot;I can't fucking believe it, that was unreal!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Real, living, breathing dinosaurs came at me and I punched them in the face! Face? Head, punched them in the head.&quot; With a satisfied sigh he rubs his hands together and points at @The boys &quot;Also, thanks for save boys.

<p>At crack of dawn, or what would be dawn if this ship was not in orbit, Gil has intently placed himself in one of Prosit's simulation chambers. He touches a panel on the wall and the empty room appears to morph into a firing range hundreds of meters long. An array of weaponry materializes on the nearest wall, but Gil only has eyes for one. &quot;Old trusty.&quot; He reaches towards the wall, slinking a rifle across his back. The PGM Hécate II.</p>
<p>From a nearby box, he produces and loads 7 bullets into it's magazine. Each one wider than his thumb and longer than his index. Regardless, it snaps into place all the same. Laying down for stability, he points the gun downrange. <em>Slide, chink.</em> The first bullet is chambered. And though his eyes peer though the scope and finger flirt with the trigger, disciplined, he doesn't yet shoot. Almost as if in meditation, he remains motionless. If he weren't breathing, you'd think he were dead.</p>

<h1>BANG!</h1>
<p>The gun <a href="https://youtu.be/v_vfXcvWkps?si=liNij6tAyDCeShNY&amp;t=248"><em>jerks</em></a> back with an echo as it's fired. Violently, but controlled. He peers down the scope to confirm his shot. 1800 meters downrange, 3 feet below the center circle. Quickly reaching forwards, he tweaks the scope. Chambering a second round, he prepares to fire with his adjustments. <em>Click.</em> This time, the bullet hit just a foot above. Again, he calibrates the scope. His third shot tears though the center. Bullseye. 4. 5. 6. 7 shots. The last 4 holes form a perfect square.</p>
<p><em>Of course, this is a controlled environment with motionless targets. This type of shooting merely for the fundamentals.</em></p>
<p>And as if responding to his needs, the room suddenly morphs again. The narrow rows dissipate into rainy city streets. The lights dim, fading into the darkness of the night sky. His perch in the range becomes a sky scraper. Minutes pass as his eyes scan the horizon. Suddenly a thin white man wearing <a href="https://assets.wfcdn.com/im/57681386/resize-h800-w800%5Ecompr-r85/7558/75583931/Where%27s+Waldo+Cardboard+Standup.jpg">denim jeans and a red striped shirt</a> whips around a corner. Gil points the gun downwards, taking his time to aim before firing. <em>Click</em></p>

<h1>BANG</h1>
<p>The shot's echo reverberates into the beautifully night sky. <em>You wouldn't be able to see the stars in a real city.</em> The sidewalk shatters, explodes at his target's feet. A narrow miss. His eyes close, as he takes a moment to reflect what went wrong.</p>
<p><em>A challenging exercise is a effective practice. Test my limits, know my weaknesses.</em></p>
<p>With a snap, the scene changes again. This time, he lays in the bushes in the outskirts of a fiery field. Spotting the man again, he aims. He fires, a direct hit. The scene changes. He spots the man. He fires. Near miss. The scene changes. Direct hit. Off center. Direct hit.</p>
<p><em>Slow is smooth, smooth is fast. Be like water, and flow with every disturbance.</em></p>
<p>His practice continues</p>

<p>A neon sign of an arrow points toward a corridor, and then down another corridor, and then down a third, a fourth, fifth, and eventually you turn the leftiest left and step into an amazing space-beach that'd put the best Bahama day to space-shame with its amazing space-waves and space-sands and space.</p>
<p>Gaze up? Space. Forward? Beach, with space behind it. Left? Palm trees, and also space. Right? You know it. Space. It's truly space-beach-irific.</p>
<p>In groovy swim trunks, an unbuttoned hawaiian shirt, sunglasses, a straw hat, and a blunt in his mouth, Adam tends to a space-barbeque on the space-beach. The lad's making space-burgers and space-kebab. Also, like a bucket of candy canes on Christmas there's an unsmokeable amount of blunts in two different cases besides a plethora of space-beach chairs, a space-volleyball court, and a pool table. The pool table is fairly normal and not really worthy of being on the space-beach if we're being real.</p>
<p>Adam is whistling while he flips some space-patties.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, how's it going&quot; Cole says, giving her hand a single firm shake.</p>
<p>He follows N4NOs eyes to the view and nods in agreement. &quot;Same here actually. But in my places case it's quakes. A few people tried sailing but nobody ever heard from them again.&quot;</p>

<p>Adam's just flipping away as the crowd grows. He gives a new waves and nods but is otherwise just whistling to himself as he cooks.</p>
<p>Timed like clockwork, rows of space-burgers and space-kebabs finish up and are lopped onto two plates. He nonchalantly throws them both like frisbees onto a table in the middle Mr DAD, Cole &quot;The Deva&quot; lourie, and N4NOR1NA_MACROSS. The contents do not so much as even stir as they groovily fly through the air and come to a perfect stop. &quot;Chow down, amigos.&quot;</p>
<p>Without further adieu, Adam goes back to cooking more and smoking his blunt.</p>

<p>&quot;Thanks brother.&quot; Cole says, shoveling half of his burger down.</p>

<p>N4NO takes a few respectable bites out of her burger, and her eyes grow larger. &quot;Delicious!&quot; she declares. &quot;It has been quite some time since I've had a burger.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As for why I was picked...&quot; N4NO pauses a moment, &quot;it could be due to my reputation among the fellow rangerbots back home. I don't suppose any of us will find out the true answer though, will we?&quot;</p>

<p>N4NO enters the room gingerly, taking delicate steps. You see that she has changed from her simple t-shirt and cardigan ensemble to a luxurious floor-length shimmering blue dress, cut with a slit up one leg, and partially backless. Her outfit demands attention as every bit of N4NO's features seem to sparkle in the light of the room. Even her chrome facial features seem to beam with extra radiance as she exclaims, &quot;So many prehistoric creatures! If only I had more time, my sensors could have gathered more data! Oh, what a night...&quot; she trails off as she takes a sip from her champagne glass and stands a nearby table.</p>

<p>Benedict rushes out of the room, seemingly in a hurry to change. After a few minutes, he returns, now wearing a sharp, black tuxedo. The fitted jacket complements his figure, while the white shirt and black trousers complete the classic look. A vibrant red tie finishes the look. His brown, messy hair is now visible, as he has chosen not to wear his top hat.</p>

<p>The music stops.</p>
<p>Maximillian suddenly rises from his throne. Silently, he begins to descend from his perch high above the dancefloor. Shortly after, <a href="https://youtu.be/bvj25SpFUJ8">new music begins to play throughout the hall</a>.</p>
<p>The room flashes with a brilliant light that casts shadows across the entire party hall. Outside the ship, whichever world they had been orbiting for the past day had been struck by something truly disastrous and was now thrust into the rapid process of its own obliteration. The explosive spectacle sent chunks of rock and magma every which way. Some collide into the ship only to be vaporized on contact by some sort of force field. Every person onboard was getting front row tickets to this hapless world's annihilation.</p>
<p>Almost as suddenly as all of this began, the world was all but gone, minus a lingering debris field quickly scattering into space. In an instant the ship orbited a new world, and again, it, like the last world, was destroyed in much the same fashion. With each world's destruction came a flash of its unique identifier along the ship's window. In that vein, every contender in Maximillian's abhorrent game knew at that point the identification of their own world -- &quot;Earth-&quot; followed by a string of numbers and letters.</p>
<p>One of these worlds fights back, and you watch as, as soon as it appears in the Prosit's viewport, a fleet of spaceships sit between the Prosit and the Earth. They launch a barrage of ordnance, but every artillery piece, every rocket, every laser, all easily repelled by the Prosit's shields. Maximilian simply nods as the weapon fires past the fleet, destroying the Earth. The Prosit moves on.</p>
<p>Fortunately, no world belonging to the current players met such a terrible fate... yet. After nearly twenty minutes of awful destruction the ship began to cycle through each of the champion's worlds one after another, viewing it from orbit for one minute before cycling to the next, repeating until the night finally arrived.</p>

<p>Gil's bleak expression is only seen by the glass viewports of Prosit's chassis. His palm slides down the wall in a silent horror and dread. <em>Even that Earth's military was not enough.</em> Regardless he looks on and watches, analyzing the movement of Prosit, looking for a pattern where it appears, finding anything that can be brought home.</p>
<p>He remembers one of his teachings, a fundamental of the monastery. &quot;If you look for the light, you can often find it. But if you look for the dark that is all you will ever see.”</p>

<p>DAD steps into room. No longer empty.
Pacing around the room a pained expression lines his face.</p>
<p>'I know what I said a moment ago but situations change...' the sounds of a dying Earth still ringing in his ears</p>
<p>He takes a deep breath and begins calling people into the room:</p>

<p>&quot;Sir Mechanical beast&quot; UNIT-13BM
&quot;My beloved daughter&quot; DEKKA DYNOMITE
&quot;The Rascals&quot;  The Boys
&quot;A lovely robot&quot;  N4NOR1NA_MACROSS

&quot;The lovely performer&quot; Faelorei Valindar
&quot;Buc... Mr. Delta Seven&quot; Kuro Viridian
&quot;and the Mad Lad himself&quot; Adam Brando</p>
<p>&quot;I have a request for all of you.&quot; DAD climbs onto a stage in front of a green wall and begins:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCgCbXmWvzA</p>

<p>Exiting the dabbing stance. DAD grabs a near by glass and raises it
&quot;Whether we are friend or foe in this game, we have a common enemy. Shall we stand united or break individually?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I understand this is a common room and there are eyes everywhere. If you wish to discuss something in private there are plenty of private rooms to the side&quot;</p>

<p>Adam is literally riding a bicycle with not one, but <em>two</em> blunts in hand when he rides into the room. He stops, listens to DAD's speech, and pulls out a pair of sunglasses from his back pocket that he then puts on. &quot;Groovy.&quot;</p>
<p>He gives DAD a thumbs up of the grooviest proportions.</p>

<p>Kuwabara stops sniffling, instead bursting into rage.

<p>&quot;It was my pleasure cooking for that man&quot; DAD says wiping away the beginnings of a sheet of tears</p>
<p>&quot;Once this is all said and done, we shall have a feast in his name using nothing but the best meats and beer money can buy&quot;</p>

<p>DAD returns to the center of the room and raises his glass
&quot;I was surprised that there were so many to join the cause this quickly. I am eternally greatful for each and every one of you. May the tailwinds of our fortune remain strong throughout the night&quot;</p>
<p>Looking directly towards the closed door where any unwanted ease droppers be listening in. DAD launches his glass towards the floor causing candied glass to scatter through out the room.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Pro-shit&quot;</strong></p>
<p>He takes a small bow and leaves the room for a night full of preparation.</p>

<p>“At last! I found one!” Exclaims the excited dragonkin as he hurries over to the springs. He discards the suit that once constrained him. Thankfully he is wearing biker shorts underneath. “Good riddance.” Öskar mutters as he steps into the steamy waters.</p>
<p>Slowly he slips down into the water. Amazingly, he’s <em>still</em> wearing the mask in the pool! He looks over to the wading Dekka. “Enjoying yourself as well, I hope. Man… I love a hot soak.”</p>

<p>“Why of course we take baths… if afforded the chance.” Öskar’s wings slowky spread out underneath him. “The royals have the best ones around, but they only allow us to use them after a successful battle. Helps refresh our bodies and minds after much combat.”</p>

<p>A new, never before seen member of the boys rushes with fury into the ballroom. &quot;GUYS! GUUUYS! <strong>GUUUUUYS!!!</strong>&quot; He shouts, rushing towards the boys. After he reaches them, he takes a moment to catch his breath, panting.</p>
<p>&quot;Bu—&quot; Tonegawa tries to speak and is cut off.</p>
<p>&quot;I've finally found it out! Shit! I've got the entire place mapped. I've found their plans, their rooms! Everything inside them! Max's weakness! Everyone's roles!&quot; He says VERY loudly.</p>

<p>This new guy suddenly de-materializes into thin air. Gone, just like dust blown off a long caked book.</p>
<p>Tonegawa, Kuwabara, and Okamoto look at each other in abject confusion.</p>
<p>The first to realize is Okamoto, who quickly scans over their group photo, his eyes darting back and forth.</p>
<p>&quot;...Huh. Would you look at that.&quot; Okamoto says matter of factly, as if this was no big deal. &quot;Tonegawa, there was some... unknown... 24th boy behind you the whole time.&quot;</p>
<p>Tonegawa and Kuwabara still look quite confused, but Okamoto can only shrug.</p>

<p>Dekka sat on the hood with her legs swinging over the vast abyss of space. The thought of leaping out into the void crosses her mind a few times, but all she does is sit there and continue to smoke. A dour heavy air consuming them. The calm before the storm.</p>

<p>&quot;Strange, right? Tranquility before chaos.&quot;</p>

<p>Once more, he speaks. This time with a slightly less coarse voice.</p>
