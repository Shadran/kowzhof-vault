<p>An entourage of various peoples surround the man as he sits back down on his throne. A few minutes later he dismisses them with a nonchalant flick of the wrist. A notification appears in the sights of every contestant, glowing similarly to their personal document. For a few seconds it shines, “We are free to speak.” The stairs leading up to the throne are largely emptied of people and none but the blond man sitting atop the central throne can be found on the highest level.</p>

<p><em>Thonk, Thonk, Thonk</em></p>
<p>The stranger’s boots echoed on each step made of the staircase. An impending metronome of the stranger’s arrival.</p>
<p><em>Thonk, Thonk, Thonk</em></p>
<p>A hefty clunk is made as they relieve their shoulders of their pack’s weight, dropping it to the floor. Standing before them now was the man known as Hovantis. They smiled kindly upon you and the majesty of space. “The Sea of Stars. Their infinite beauty is somewhat diminished having been made the object of another’s conquest.” A depressive air washes over them.</p>
<p>“I’ve walked a long way to come here. It appears I’ve arrived under-dressed.”</p>

<p>&quot;The beauty of any flower is not lessened by its gardener. There is always a keeper. In man's absence, such responsibilities fall upon the stoic orders. We have merely given nature a moment's reprieve in Our conquest. Someday it will reclaim its throne after I am gone.&quot; Maximillian smiles. Raising his free hand, he gestures to the man's body. &quot;You have arrived nonetheless. Attire can be arranged. Or not, if preferred. That which defines your world's champion is not Our place to say.&quot;</p>

<p>Hovantis’ mustache curls with his widening smile. “The champions you do not define, but the given roles &amp; rules, you certainly do. Or do you mean to imply we are truly free to act as seen fit. I wonder.”</p>
<p>Upon being offered a wardrobe change he accepts “If you’ve made the offer It would be rude to refuse. It’s been a while since I was able to dress up for celebrations after all. My current attire carries too much of an air of solitude over my weary shoulders to truly let loose. I’ll trust your tastes in the chosen attire for the festivities at hand.”</p>
<p>“Ah,” Hovantis catches himself as he came here with purpose “but it would seem I’ve already ascertained the inevitable answer from you I was seeking. Nevertheless, it is still one question worth musing. I would ask you to define what is perfection.”</p>

<p>A light tap of the butt of Maximillian's scepter against the ground beside his feet rings out rhythmically, echoing to the music emanating from the blond ruler. A faint ring made of a fuzzy golden light descends down from a thin column of radiant light, eventually stopping at chest level with Hovantis. &quot;A gift from Us to you. An artifact belonging to another ancient wayward traveler. On one's right hand, an outfit of your own inspiration. On one's left, an outfit of another's hope or image for you. So long as eye contact is shared when putting on the ring.&quot; A light chuckle escapes him. &quot;It has on occasion brought Us entertainment. Even if it is not always active.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Should Hovantis put the ring on his left hand while staring at Maximillian a spectacle of golden lights will shimmer all across his body, transforming his attire into that of an appropriately classy black suit.</em></p>
<p>&quot;As for your inquiry,&quot; the man sits upright on his throne, pulling his head back in a slight sideways tilt as if he was asked a question he had never once pondered before, &quot;perfection is the greatest sum of all flaws. An order of disorder, a beauty refined until broken, a dirtiness cleansed by its collective missteps. The multiverse was beautiful before Our arrival and it will be beautiful upon Our departure, but Our finality will mark a return to order of which time will not allow repair.&quot;</p>

<p>“I see. A very human response delivered in an equally inhuman way. I would have expected no less from the keys of this world.” The stranger spoke not out of malice but in acceptance of the given answer. “Not an answer I’d wager is acceptable to the other champions. But I am not one of the other champions. And they are not me.” The stranger spoke matter of factly, leaving little room for interpretation. A window of time was allowed for a rebel retort, but it hardly seemed necessary for one of western sensibilities.</p>
<p>Hovantis slides the gifted ring over his left, and in a dazzling flash!... whisking away the mustached fellow’s tacky hat and cumbersome pack to the shadow realm, his fashion sense rejuvenates! Into a dashing luxury suit with complementary stunning shades! No lesser quality than befitting von Blitz themselves of course. The humble traveler removes the shades, and then his top notch blazer. Pocketing the former and slinging the latter over their shoulder. A slight change in their demeanor could be noted now. The mysterious stranger’s kind smile turned to a content one. A kurt, no thrills, sayonara was uttered to you, and then the man went on his way.</p>
<p><em>Clack, Clack, Clack</em></p>
<p>A lengthy halt brings the pattering of their departure to a still silence…</p>
<p>“This game. Our perfection.They are irrelevant to a wandering traveler. The mission of my journey has not changed. I shall do as I please in my time here.” Hovantis turns around after breaking his stride and looks back up the fleet of stairs to von Blitz.</p>

<p>“It is only luck that our journeys cross paths.”</p>
<p>“It is only honorable that I thank you for this brief reprieve.”</p>
<p>“<em><strong>Arigatou.</strong></em>”</p>
<p>The man tilted his head in a bow so slight it was not appropriate for even the meager status of a middling banker, but the tone in the man’s voice. That last second, gravelly desecration. Echoing harshly throughout their every fiber of being. It rang ragged, hollow, and weary, befitting only of fifty five thousand lifetimes of sleepless nights.</p>
<p><em>Clack, Clack, Clack</em></p>
<p>The mysterious stranger departs</p>

<p>During the pause, Maximillian offers an agreement rather than a retort. &quot;As you say, they are not.&quot;</p>
<p>Nothing is said as Hovantis turns to make his initial leave. Rather, the ruler's expression alone says all that is needed to be said. A smile of contentedness, a gaze relaxed by unfaltering confidence, and a posture both commanding and somehow unimposing in this brief moment. <em>Satisfied.</em></p>
<p>At the wanderer's halt, as if their whispers could be heard across the entire hall, Maximillian softly says, entirely audible despite their distance and the commotion in the hall, &quot;Fortune's benefactors boast mercy. Destiny's, themselves.&quot; After his thanks the lights in the main party hall dim and <a href="https://youtu.be/ioDRsPb5hec">the next song begins to play</a>.</p>

<p>Continuing to match the Dude's anger with tranquility, Maximillian continues calmly, &quot;On the contraire, Our care for the multiverse is immense. How could We be uncaring of that which We've seized through the greatest conquest in history?

<p>&quot;We have established this trial which pulls from the subconscious of entire worlds. Agree or not, your own have nominated you their champion.

<p>Slowly starting up the stairs, a middle aged man with unkempt hair and his bright purple robe looks upwards at the man on the throne. Giving a large yawn, his empty hands stretch, seemingly a normal human until from out of his robe emerges a tentacle holding a cup of coffee and handing it off to his hand. Z takes a sip, finally reaching the throne and giving a sigh.&quot;</p>
<p><em>&quot;So just to make sure, this isn't some challenge of the great old ones where I'm stuck in a dream within a dream within a dream? It's happened before&quot;</em></p>

<p>Maximillian's mouth curves into a sudden smile, almost as if stifling a mere chuckle. &quot;We assure you that Our presence is no illusion. Contrary, your inclusion signifies an undeniable importance that any deity of your world would be envious of. The agency bestowed upon you encapsulates a reality more tangible than any you have ever known.&quot;</p>

<p>Z lifts the coffee cup to his lips drinking deeply before giving another sigh, this one seemingly of relief.</p>
<p><em>&quot; Well I suppose that's good at least. Still just...who or what are you to have such powers and sway with the universe to be able to assemble all these people and construct such a vast creation such as this. Are you saying that you are an even greater holder of power than the Elder Gods whos reach and influence spans the cosmos?</em>&quot;</p>

<p>The man relaxes back into his throne. &quot;We are Maximillian von Blitz, Architect of Perfection, Ruler of All. Our power is unmatched. Every universe, including yours, was conquered long ago. The <em>Elder Gods</em> you speak of are either inferior lurking powers at be, survivors of the Great War, or fabrications of an entity belonging to one of the two prior.&quot;</p>

<p>Z's grip on his coffee mug tightens and his brow furrows at the words of the man on the throne. He opens his mouth as if to speak before stopping, seeming to think at length about his words before taking a final sip of coffee, handing his empty cup to his tentacle which retreats back into his robe.</p>
<p>*&quot;What is to happen of the winner of this 'game' then? Do they return back to their home and just continue their existence?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Those who are victorious will be granted eternal passage aboard Prosit 13 and may bring with them up to 30 others from their world.&quot; A beam of light shines down, forming a column of radiant glory between Maximillian and Z. In it, a hologram-like depiction forms, showing a three dimensional animation of a tournament bracket of featuring various Earths. &quot;Your triumph will carry your world into the next round, and so on until it is the final Earth or until it is destroyed. Returning to your world, should it ultimately prove the most perfect, is something We allow. Though, the odds are astronomical.&quot;</p>

<p>Gritting his teeth Z begins to step towards the throne, angrily stomping up the stairs. You can see a variety of tentacles writhing out of his robe now as he lifts a finger towards the man on the throne</p>
<p>*&quot;You would truly destroy and alter the worlds of billions? Take the lives of uncountable innocents? What of our families? My wife, my children, the family members of those who didn't even have a chance at this opportunity? And for what exactly the pursuit of perfection? I was happy in my world, loving life excited to greet each day with a smile and a yawn and you would take that from me? From all of us?&quot;</p>

<p>Practically the moment that the stairway is cleared, Seseri swoops down from above and lands a few feet away from Blitz, crossing her arms and stomping up to him in an obviously angry manner.</p>
<p>Once she reaches him, she starts tapping her foot impatiently, before turning to gesture to the rest of the grand hall. Moments later, she lets out a loud call, a small pulse of light shooting off from her in all directions as she does.</p>
<p>&quot;Fweet!?&quot;</p>

<p>He stares for a few seconds before smiling and closing his eyes. &quot;I suppose We have made inadequate accommodations.&quot; He lifts his free hand and loudly snaps his fingers. A beam of radiant light begins to shine down between him and Seseri. Slowly descending through the column of light, befitting the magnificence of the holy grail itself, is a simple pen and paper. As soon as it is grabbed by Seseri the pillar of light vanishes.</p>

<p>&quot;Fweet? Fweet!?&quot; Seseri lets out several more angry trills, stomping her foot dramatically as she does so, before snatching the pen and paper out of the air.
She starts furiously writing down on the page, nearly ripping it in the process, before shoving it into Blitz' face.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Who the hell are you and what did you do with my exploration partners!?!?!!? You should be lucky I know how to write in the Ancestor's language!&quot;</em></p>

<p>She turns to the pen and paper for a moment before looking up to the air above them. Moments later, she looks to almost deflate, letting out a high-pitched sigh.
A few moments later, she turns back to Blitz, a new message in hand.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Why though? What's the point of all this? If you're as powerful as you make yourself sound, what could you possibly hope to gain from all this?&quot;</em></p>

<p>&quot;We had seized the universe,&quot; a beam of radiant light shines down once more between them, this time containing a moving hologram-like depiction of a scene showing an epic space battle and flashes of various ceremonies and celebrations, &quot;and yet hungered still. The greater multiverse became Our next obsession. Such conquest occupied Us for a time, but, too, was eventually seized.&quot; The imagery before Seseri changes, now depicting world after world being obliterated by numerous means, magnificent and not. &quot;In Our boredom we sought perfection. A universe of only the most perfect worlds. Champions hailing from throughout the multiverse contend to prove their world's worth. In time, only one of each world shall exist and Our perfect universe finally be seized.&quot; The sights shift, showing various Earths. &quot;The world, Earth, is now under examination. Most Earths have been destroyed, but many more are yet to be vanquished. Your victory will guarantee your Earth's continuation in this examination. Perhaps its eventual place in Our perfect universe will be owed to your efforts.&quot; The beam of light disappears along with its various depictions of Earth.</p>

<p>Seseri listens to the man's explanation silently and without any outward reaction.
Once he finished, she silently took to her notepad once more, calmly closing the distance between the two and handing him one more note, her glow, far brighter than it had been before.</p>
<p>Once she handed him the letter she silently took off into the sky.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Perfection is impossible. And you, Maximilian von Blitz, are a monster.&quot;</em></p>

<p>&quot;You must be the captain of this... ship, I suppose? I apologize if this seems rude, but there's a question I have to get off my chest. You wouldn't happen to be the crew who dropped a strange box on the earth about 30 years ago, would you?&quot;</p>

<p>“Be my guest.” Gestures Archibald to a nearby seat. Initially he doesn’t look directly at Ami, but once he does, he’s immediately taken aback. This doesn’t last thankfully and he resumes his composure. “Golly. I’ve really seen everything, haven’t I? First a bird lady, now a mushroom lady…” He mutters to himself.</p>
<p>“I appreciate your compliment! My take the utmost care of my attire. Looking my Sunday best is what gives me vigor.” He booms enthusiastically. “As for our predicament, I hold a similar sentiment to most of our fellow shipmates. This is inexcusable. To be thrust away from our homes for this rubbish is a crime against humanity!” The Count comments with disdain. “That said, I do intend to return to my world. My daughter will not be taken away from me! Likewise you have loved ones you wish to ve reunited with, don’t you?”</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, there are several people I hope to see again very soon,&quot; Ami replies. &quot;Where I'm from, people either have plant growths, animal appendages, or some other strange mutations. It's a culture shock to see so many... normal looking people around.&quot;</p>

<p>Yumi emerges from the crowd shortly afterward. &quot;Aha-ha! Looks like you, my fine stashed friend, were able to sneak a friend upon this here ship! Tell me, if I may ask a question or two and a moment of your time?&quot;</p>

<p>Before Archibald has ample time to respond, however, she lands herself plumply onto a chair at the table. &quot;I've always wanted a pet, the idea had been romanticized in the books of the past, yet it has always been taboo because of the food shortages.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where you hail from, does everyone have someone like your Cedric?&quot;</p>

<p>The man politely welcomes the unfamiliar woman. “Salutations, miss. I’m happy to indulge your questions. Provided they're the reasonable sort, of course.” He chuckles. Cedric peeks out briefly to inspect Yumi, but disappears just as quickly.</p>
<p>“Yes, this is Cedric, my shy animal companion. I suppose ferrets are not exactly common pets compared to cats and dogs, but the concept of owning animals is not foreign where I come from. It’s quite a shame you’re not afforded the same luxury. The idea of animals being restricted purely as a resource sounds quite tragic.” Suddenly the gentleman clasps a hand over his forehead. “Oh where are my manners? Seems I didn’t properly introduce myself yet. I am the third Count of the Don Castro family, but please just call me Archibald. Even Archie is fine. I’m not opposed to nicknames.” Archibald bows his head slightly. “May I have the pleasure of knowing your namesake, miss?”</p>

<p>When Cedric makes a brief appearance, Yumi's face lights up as her eyes track Cedric. Her eyes beam with joy, and her mouth agape with excitement.</p>
<p>She straightens her posture trying to return to a more professional look &quot;Oh-! Yes, of course. It'd be nothing but daft of me to skip the introductions, wouldn't it?&quot; She extends her hand for a handshake. &quot;Yumi Dae, Director of the South Section 3 of the Chi Association. A pleasure to make your acquaintance, Archie.&quot; A subtle change in her tone suggests she's said this countless times.</p>
<p>She resumes her previous mannerisms. &quot;Well, mostly I was curious about this Cederic and how you were able to get him aboard this ship. But now you've piqued my interest again; It seems like you come from an influential family in society. Might I ask what role you filled just a few days ago?&quot;</p>

										</div>										<div class='conversation-post-body'>
<p>The Count accepts the handshake without hesitation. His grasp is noticeably gentle. “Pleased to meet you as well, Miss Yumi.” Archibald appears impressed upon the mention of her position. “Ah, so you’re a director! Sounds like the busy kind too. I’d say this break of routine might’ve served as your holiday, but the dire stakes as said by that head honcho there speaks otherwise.” To avoid branching over to a potentially uncomfortable subject, he clears his throat and changes topic back at Yumi’s inquiries.</p>
<p>“Cedric here appears to have been simultaneously escorted with me when that Max fellow whisked me away. Why it was him and not, say, my butler Wayne… I cannot tell. Probably for the better as Cedric fares poorly without my company.” Archibald ponders the new question posed by Yumi. “My role. Well, I was piloting my airship, the <em>Aubergine</em>, to deliver a speech to New Gloucester. This aircraft is nothing to sneeze at, but it pales to the magnificence of my <em>Aubergine</em>! Anyways, basically I’ve been touring the world to influence, assist, and inspire hope among the less privileged of society. Someone has to look out for the smaller people in life, I say.”</p>

<p>Yumi nods in approval with your answer.
&quot;Ah, an airship! I've yet to see one with my own two eyes~ Must have been *quite *extravagant to best this one.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Y'know, I'd always thought that the world could always use more people like you... Using their power and influence to better the world, not shape it to their whims. You've got a noble cause and the power to act on it. I've always strived to be like that myself, but it's a difficult journey to the top. You're a good man, Archie. Friend or foe, I am glad to have met you like this.&quot;</p>

<p>“Well I’d never admit my pride and joy is inferior to this ship, technological advancements or otherwise. That’d be sacrilege!” Archibald scoffs with a smile.</p>
<p>The Count’s smile continues upon being praised by the young woman, though it dims over time. “You flatter me, Miss Yumi. Honestly… I just wish I woken up much sooner. If only I recognized how vile and selfish my original ‘friends’ who take advantage of so many people. Who not only excommunicated me but refused to help my wife Gwendolyn, whose health was in decline, and then she…” Archie stops midway, rubbing his eyes periodically. Eventually he continues. “My apologies, Miss Yumi. We stumbled upon a sensitive area. Needless to say, I was once part of aristocracy, full of naïveté and ignorance. So I can’t help but partially blame myself for aiding the problem. Even as I intend to undo the curruption I was blind to, this is something I’ll never forgive myself. <em>Sigh</em>.” He looks at Yumi gratefully. “Sorry for blathering like that. I appreciate you lending an ear. I too am glad to be acquainted with you. Despite any potential revelations, I intend to remain on good terms with you.”</p>
<p>“Now, what kind of world are you part of? I’m quite curious considering its harsh attitudes towards owning pets.”</p>

<p>Waving her hands back and forth &quot;No no, no worries at all Sir Archie. Lending an ear is the least of my worries.&quot;</p>

<p>Inquisitively she begins, &quot;Now now, would you like to hear about the beginning of the end, or start at the current state of affairs?&quot;</p>
<p>Yumi thinks to herself for a moment. <em>hmmm</em> &quot;Both are generally heavy topics, but i find neither personally sensitive. If you're in the mood for such an account, I'd be happy to elaborate. No pressure though&quot;</p>

<p>Excited to recount the tales of her people, Yumi continues &quot;Yes! Of course. I hope you don't mind some dramatics 😉&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Today, I shall treat you with the tale of my people!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Ten days of Twilight, as it is now known began with a dawn that never came.&quot; Yumi extends her pointer, pointing towards the heavens. &quot;Before the sky had risen, the sky began to shimmer a subtle translucent blue. Soon after, bright rays of sunshine filled the sky, but alas the sun had not moved. This, my friend, was the beginning of the end.&quot;</p>
<h1>DRAMATIC PAUSE</h1>
<p>&quot;The people of the three cities that remain today had known no better at the time. But those who found themselves outside what seemed to be a barrier, were all too aware of changes that had occurred. First electronics stopped working. I'm sure you know what that means; critical infrastructure failures, loss of communications, and of course the great loss of information and the internet.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;By the second day, there had been 24 hours of twilight in the cities. People realized and panic set in, but nobody could come or go. By the end of the tenth day of twilight the sun finally rose upon the cities. But alas, it was too late. In just 240 hours, half the earth came became scorched, the other half frozen. Completely uninhabitable.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The magnetic field of the earth lost composure and cosmic rays began to beat down upon it. The results of this phenomenon are what my people call the corruption. I of course, explore the corruption and exterminate monsters within! The rest, however? History!&quot;</p>

<p>While the Count follows Yumi’s story, he gives subtle reactions of intrigue, shock, concern, and puzzlement. The last emotion stuck once the girl finishes.</p>
<p>“You seem… unusually cheerful describing what sounds to be a near apocalyptic hellscape. That said,” Archies expression softens, “I think it’s good to have someone as enthusiastic as you are. Imagine how dour things would be if everyone held the same hopeless, cynical demeanor. I’m sure you act as the heart of your team being the director. Now, what kind of monsters do you normally encounter?”</p>

<p>&quot;Why yes! I think I'd be quite problematic to kill the mood with a sob story of my world. People love tragedy, and this is no different...&quot;</p>
<p>Yumi pauses briefly, almost as if reconsidering what she's about to share. &quot;Besides! I was born way after the event I'd just described so its all pretty normal to me.</p>
<p>Yumi takes a moment to explain the following flow chart and how she approaches her problems:</p>

<p>&quot;The monsters? The come in all shapes and sizes. Many are humanoid, some are gargantuan, and others tiny. Anything you can imagine, there's a good chance its out there. No two creatures have been quite the same though. The worst ones are those that work together. I've lost good men from smart monsters. Nothing to do but learn, adapt, and <strong>never</strong> get complacent.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Theres a saying, what was it?-- <em>tsc tsc tsc tsc</em>-- Ah! Quick on your feet, hard to defeat.&quot;</p>

<p>The Count stares back at the elderly woman utterly stupefied. “I… beg your pardon?” He looks both perplexed and somewhat offended at whatever Juliana was implying. There is an uncomfortable, awkward pause. Thankfully, someone was there to break the silence.</p>
<p><em>teet teet teet!</em></p>
<p>“Not so noisy, Cedric. I can’t have…” The gentleman’s eyes widened as he makes the realization and he begins laughing quietly. “Madame, there seems to be a misunderstanding. I believe you saw me talking to my pet whom you couldn't see. My ferret, Cedric, tends to reside in my coat. If you’re lucky, maybe he’ll take a peek, but I wouldn’t count on it.

<p>Excited sounds come from within Archibald’s coat. The ferret pops even its head out and doesn't appear intimidated by the bird person. <em>yip!</em></p>
<p>“Well I never! Seems like my Cedric has taken a liking to you!” Marvels Archibald, “That’s quite rare. Perhaps you two are able to communicate?” The gentleman examines Seseri with a puzzled expression. “Interesting. A avian humanoid. Is it even possible to talk with this being?”</p>

I am Count Archibald Don Castro III, but simply Archibald will suffice. An ‘ancestor’ you say? I only have a daughter. Not sure I’ve started a lineage long enough to be referred as that.” The Count chuckles dryly. “Are human beings rare or even extinct where you come from? Also, if you’re able to tell me, I’m curious to know what kind of conversation you had with Cedric. If you could understand him, of course.”</p>

<p>Seseri lets out a low, mournful trill as she writes, before handing Archibald a note.</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Extinct, I'm afraid... when the darkness fell your people were among the first to go, according to surviving records. No one is sure why. By the time the planet sent forth the Daysprings to give us light and warmth, your people were long gone. Your people are called the Ancestors because you came before, and we call ourselves Descendants because, among other things, we came after you.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;As for Cedric... he's drawn to the light inside of me. Our Light springs from the planet itself, natural and warm. It was gifted to us by the Springs when the Darkness first fell so we could lead the remaining life on our planet to safety. And yeah, I can understand him! We mostly just introduced ourselves, he says hi to you by the way.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Archibald solemnly reads along. “I see… so my kind was a doomed species in your world. What a pity. In some sense, I wonder if it was brought upon themselves. Humans are capable of doing some of best things and the worst things. I know this since I’m afraid I’ve heard and encountered some very bad people in my life. I wonder if this was judgement by…”</p>
<p>Not wanting to sour the mood, he changes the topic back to his pet. “Well I’m glad you’ve made a friend of Cedric. I’m envious of your animal communication skills in fact! It’s quite the gift. He might not look it, but he can be a real rascal sometimes! Just the other other day I left my bubble tea out while I doing an errand and this scamp-” <em>Tetetetetetete!</em> You could hear what sounds to be animal like laughter coming from the mischievous ferret. “Yes you! You drank every last drop! What am I to do with you?”</p>

<p>Seseri laughs loudly as the two banter, sending out the odd pulse towards Cedric which earns clearly amused yips in return. &quot;Fweet! Fw-Fweet!&quot;</p>
<p>Once her laughter has calmed down to giggles, she straightens out her wing feathers before putting pen to paper.
<em>&quot;I won't say that's an uncommon theory amongst our people.
The shroud that covers the world outside of spring-side cities is known to be thickest in Ancestor Cities, having explored them myself you can practically <strong>taste</strong> the cold and decay in the air. Some have taken that as proof the Ancestors somehow brought it upon themselves, others say that it's proof that an outside entity focused on the most dangerous targets first.</em>
*And those are only the two most popular theories, all we know is that your people were probably involved in some way, good or bad. For better or for worse, your people were long dead by the time we were uplifted from doves.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Cedric says it tasted delicious, by the way!&quot;*</p>

<p>“Oh <em>did</em> he? I would never have guessed! Not even my daughter would be so cheeky.” The gentleman pouts indignantly as Cedric continues chattering.</p>
<p>Engrossed by the lore shared by the avian lady, Archibald appears resigned upon hearing the possible outcomes of his people’s extinction. “I see. So there are multiple theories. Alas, I don’t foresee this mystery being solved anytime soon. Still… it must be exciting to meet me. I’m not the only human here, as you might’ve noticed.”</p>

<p>Looking around at the various humans in the room, Seseri lets out an excited chirp. <em>&quot;It definitely is! I've spent my entire life studying your civilization but I never thought I would get to meet any of you in the flesh! Well... alive, that is.&quot;</em> Seseri grimaces. <em>&quot;My 20th hatchday is in a month, and my partners Yaki and Tori both turned 20 earlier this year.

<p>“Yes, my daughter is quite the handful. Bright and lovely girl, but still cheeky. As I put her into a private school in British India for a resplendent education as well as safety, it’s been several months since I lost saw her. Hopefully she hasn’t held a grudge about that. Despite my many letters to her, replies have been on the sparse side. I suppose she’s in that rebellious age. If you’re curious about her looks, there’s a picture of her that I keep in my pocket.” He reaches inside his coat and pulls out a small framed photo of a young girl. “This is Cynthia, my lovely child. She means the absolute world to me.”</p>

<p>Upon her mention of exploration the Count appears quite impressed. “You’re one for adventure too, eh? And someone so young as well. It’s big world out there. No better use than to make it your oyster and learn something of it! It’s wise that you brought along trusted companions as well. I always had my butler and good friend Wayne to be my right hand man. I’m sure he’s handling my <em>Aubergine</em> quite well in my absence.”</p>

<p>“Gladly! Wayne is my personal butler and close friend. We met while I was studying in Oxford. He’s originally from the United British Principalities of American, but transferred to Great Britain as a student. He’s not a refined butler like most. He’s boisterous and rowdy, and fully speaks his mind. A man I need in my life to make sure I don’t lose track of myself.” Archibald nods with a grin.</p>
<p>“As for my daughter, she’s my only child. Cynthia is sweet girl, and one to like sweets herself. That’s where her mischief comes in! If I ever found a box of cookies or a gallon of ice cream completely empty, she will no doubt be the culprit. She also enjoys fashion, socializing, and video games like most children her age. Sadly, her attitude has become gradually choleric. Not to the point of being a spoiled brat, mind you, but it’s obvious my Cynthia has… changed. Perhaps my daughter is just ‘that age’ as she’s in mid teens now, but part of me wonders if her mother’s passing… that is to say my late wife, had something to influence her behavior. I fear sending her to school in India might not have helped her mood either, but I genuinely that was the best coarse of action for both her education as well as her potential safety. I sure hope you haven’t had to deal with the untimely loss of a family member. You never really feel the same afterwards.”</p>

<p><em>&quot;I lost my pa to an expedition gone wrong at an early age... the grief never really leaves you, does it? Seems that's something in common between us, at least.&quot;</em>
Seseri lets out a low, mournful trill.</p>
<p><em>&quot;You would send her away? wouldn't isolating her from all she knows just further dampen her mood?&quot;</em></p>
<p>Seseri tilts her head, resting her chin on her knuckle. <em>&quot;Butlers... if I recall, they're like assistants, right? I'd certainly <strong>hope</strong> a person like that would speak their mind. What would the point be otherwise?&quot;</em></p>

<p>“You lost your father at an early too? My condolences.” Archibald shakes his head sadly. “You can never truly take the kives of others for granted. Mine passed when I was roughly in my teens. He was a stern man, much more than I, but he was never abusive or cruel. The death was due to old age. When I was conceived my father was well into his mid 50s.”</p>
<p>The Count sports a guilty look when Seseri brings up her insight concerning Cynthia. “Truth be told, I always wondered if that would be the case. Even with the letters I frequently send her, her replies are uncommon in return. However,” He resumes his composure “That’s not to say I regret my decision. Cynthia has friends at her school, is apparently doing a great job academically, and most importantly in an environment that is safe. I’m unhappy that I might’ve furthered deepened a rift, but I have hope she’ll forgive me in time. I live a more hazardous life than you realize, and the idea of losing another loved one is unbearable. Surely that’s understandable?”</p>

<p>Archibald snaps his fingers. “Exactly! Wayne is more or less a personal helper of mine. Compared to me who prefers to play it safe, he’s more of a risktaker. When he staunchly believes in a certain action, I almost always take it. Sure enough, they usually pay off. Having a ‘yes man’ would result in stagnation and false assurance. I know too many such people when I was once part of the Midas Club.”</p>

<p>*&quot;The two of you compliment each other and in doing so you achieve more than either of you could do alone. It's common back home, out of sheer necessity in the face of outside threats.</p>
<p>As for my own pa, as I said, he was lost to an expedition gone wrong. We don't know the full details - as is, unfortunately, very common - but none of his fellows returned... We all know the risks. I myself nearly died on my first mission, it was only through the quick thinking of my partners that I returned home alive. Let's just say Ma wasn't too happy - she's been awfully protective of me and my nestmates since Pa died.&quot;*</p>

<p>Seseri takes off from the throne, circling the room from above for a minute before idly landing on a structural support near the edge of the room a few metres off the ground and perching on it. &quot;Fweet...&quot; she trills softly, looking around the room wildly.</p>
<p>&quot;Fweet!&quot; She jumps off the support, using her wings to break her fall, enthusiastically walking towards the rest of the group, pen and paper in hand.</p>

<p>The chair spotting the birdperson and still freaked out about being the only alive chair and seeing moving humans looks shocked at the approach of the bird. &quot;Please stay back, I mean no harm! You birds are always ruining my fabric and that is not a problem I do not wish to have!&quot;</p>

<p>She then notices the pen and paper and pauses for a moment. &quot;Could.... You perhaps be using that paper to talk with us? I-I will stay for now and listen to what you have to write. But if you try to rip my fabric I am not affraid to fight back!&quot;</p>

<p>Seseri tilts her head, staring blankly at the Chair in front of her.
After a few moments, she takes off her mask, as if to get a clearer picture. With the covering of her mask gone, one could see that instead of normal eyes, Seseri's eyes glow a stark gold against her black facial feathers. She has a small beak where her mouth would be.
She blinks several times, covering her eyes with a wing several times more, her expression slowly changing from confusion to bewilderment. Putting her mask back on, she quickly passes a note to Janet.</p>

<p>After initially surveying her new surroundings and peers, Victoria chooses to approach the bird alien. She puts on an approximation of a friendly smile.
&quot;I don't recognise your species. From where in our solar system do you hail?&quot;
She holds out a stiff hand to shake.
&quot;I am from Earth.&quot;</p>

<p>Seseri tilts her head as she looks up at Victoria. &quot;Fweet? Fweet...&quot; She says quietly as if muttering to herself. No pulses accompany either sound.
After bringing out her pad, she writes on a page, tears it out and hands it to Victoria.</p>
<p><em>&quot;I'm also from Earth! Just... uh, a different Earth. I think jerkface on his throne over there would be able to tell you more. I'm a Descendant.

<p>Henry watches Seseri run warily. He holds a cigar in his mouth and pulls out a gold-plated zippo lighter, trying, and failing, to feed his addiction. He momentarily catches Seseri’s eye and he smiles thinly, holding up a hand as a greeting, before continuing to fiddle with the uncooperative lighter.</p>

<p>A quick flap of her wings later, and Seseri has landed in front of Henry, fweeting at him enthusiastically.
Taking a moment to regard the cigar, she quickly brings out her pad, jottling down on it for a second before handing it to Henry.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Can I hold that... thing for a second? what is it?&quot;</em></p>

<p>Henry is barely able to disguise his grimace. He looks at the bipedal bird and back to his obviously expensive cigar.</p>
<p>&quot;Sure... Just be careful, I want it back&quot; He finally says.</p>
<p>&quot;It's something I use for recreational purposes, and I imagine they're gonna be hard to coime by here&quot;</p>

<p>She picks up the cigar, holding it gently in her hands and regarding it idly. Given it already looked big in Henry's hands, the cigar looks absolutely massive in Seseri's. After regarding it visually for a moment, she lifts her mask slightly from the bottom, putting the Cigar close to her still-covered face. After a moment she physically recoils back, hastily handing the cigar back to Henry.</p>

<p>For a brief moment, Ami makes eye contact with Seseri and, beneath her mushroom cap, her eyes widen in excitement as she moves closer to the bird. &quot;Hey there! You seem excited to be here. Can you still speak a human language?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fweet? Fweet Fweet. Fweet?&quot; Seseri seems hesitant to approach Ami, but hands her a note nonetheless.
<em>&quot;To be <strong>here?</strong> No. I left my partners stranded in the middle of the shroud because I was plucked away to be here and I have no way back. As for languages, we talk in other ways. Pulsing, mostly. We were never human to begin with.&quot;</em></p>

<p>&quot;Ah, I'm sorry! I did not mean to offend you,&quot; Ami says, bowing slightly. &quot;For some reason, I assumed you were a human-bird hybrid, as I see them often back home.

<p>Seseri tilts her head heavily sideways at the mention of 'human-bird hybrids', letting out a soft, low fweet once Ami finishes speaking.</p>
<p>She takes out her pad and starts scribbling with it. A minute later, she lets out a frustrated sound and practically rips the paper out, crumpling it up and stuffing it into a pocket. She proceeds to do this several more times before visibly deflating, and the next paper is given to Ami instead of being crumpled.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Human-bird... hybrids? Assuming you mean the Ancestors, no. Your people have been extinct for centuries where I'm from. As for my partners... they're Yaki and Tori, my partners in crime! We've been together since our first year in the academy, playing pranks, training together and basically anything else you can think of. The three of us were asleep when I was plucked from my spot between their wings by jerkface on his throne over there.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Ami lets out a slight gasp and puts one hand up to her mushroom cap, approximately where her mouth would be. &quot;I wonder what caused humans to go extinct in  your world... given what has happened to mine, it's surprising people are even still around.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You mentioned the academy - were you in the military before, or more of a scholarly type?&quot;</p>

<p><em>&quot;More of the latter, I guess, but closer to a bit of both. We trained to become explorers, hardened survivalists who can venture out into the shroud and survive. The scholarly aspect comes in studying what is out there, mostly the remains of Ancestor structures... but that's where the shroud tends to be thickest, so it's extremely dangerous. Most human cities are swarming with the corrupted and visibility is so bad even our own internal lights barely do anything. That same shroud is what killed off your people - without the internal light we possessed you had no resistance against the darkness. It killed you from inside out.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;We're... not sure of the full specifics. We know it's covered most of our world, that it kills and warps anything without light to resist it and casts an endless night upon the land, with only the areas near the spring having any light at all.

<p>&quot;That sounds very similar to the Altering on my world... they say it started out as a sort of pixelated fog that eventually seeped into everything and spread out across the globe.

<p>The caveman begins sprinting about the room at incredibly high speeds. He zooms over to many a strange artifact held in a case, sometimes stomping his feet repeatedly when he arrives at a particularly interesting one, before another catches his eye and he runs off towards it. He glances towards the other strange contestants before whipping his head back to the other curiosities. He doesn't seem to have any immediate interest in talking to anyone as he falls to the ground and rolls on it, running his hands over the spaceship's floor before rising to his feet and doing the same to its walls. By this point he is panting, an excited look in his eyes as he looks around.</p>

<p>&quot;No, there are some who are taller. Some are mightier. Some are shorter, some are thinner, some are weaker. Some are women, and Grug is definitely not a woman. Some men have longer beards, but Grug endeavors to keep his short to avoid it being scorched by flames. Some who spend more time in the sun come back with skin which is darker, not near as much as yours... though some who spend too much come back home red.&quot; Grug chuckles.</p>

<p>&quot;Nobody as dark as me huh? did you get to know many other people or just those who live near you? Also, it doesn't seem you were one of the ones who spend much time under the sun.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There are no other people near Grug's tribe.&quot; He says flatly. &quot;Grug and his tribe and all the world were cursed for our ancestors actions, who pulled at godhood, so the gods struck them down, and their anger continues to this day. Or perhaps it did until they brought Grug here...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Grug used to leave home more often, but was given the high honor of staying back at the cave and tending to the fire. For 93 moons Grug has been the one to tend the fire.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So you are a cave dweller, maybe a bit more of sun and grass can do you some good instead of just staring at a fire all day.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;From where I am from people that look like me are not rare at all, there are probably others as dark as me living far away from where you live, maybe if you come back alive to your tribe you may one day meet them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't Grug know it!&quot; He says in response to the first remark.</p>
<p>&quot;Truly? Amazing! So people with your skin just <em>are</em>? You are born with skin such as that instead of like normal?&quot; At this point Grug has approached and seems to be disregarding personal space as he reaches out to grab a hold of one of the man's arms, trying to get a better look.</p>

<p>Seseri practically <em>squawks</em> as Grug runs by, hastily jumping out of the way before staring out in the direction he ran off in. She continues to keep an eye on him as he continues to run, getting out of the way of any possible collisions beforehand.</p>
<p>When he finally stops, she takes off into the air, gently landing next to him moments later, note in hand. After fweeting at him in an annoyed fashion she hands him the note.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Hey, you nearly knocked me over! be more careful n~~o~~ext time!&quot;</em></p>

<p>Grug looks at the note. &quot;Grug is amazed! Astounded! Scratchings upon this item entail meaning, meaning which Grug can somehow comprehend!&quot; He jumps straight up and down, barely bending his knees, springing off the balls of his feet. He rotates the note back and forth in the air, looking at it up and down, before glancing down at the small bird person.</p>
<p>&quot;Small bird person!&quot; Without any warning his hands jolt forward to Seseri and he runs his hands through her feathers, sometimes sort of grabbing but not pulling.</p>

<p>&quot;F-fweet!&quot; Seseri makes a shocked noise as the larger man suddenly reaches out for her, practically jumping out of his grip. Once at a safe distance, she stares up at him for several moments before putting her hand to her chest and taking a deep breath, idly reaching over to adjust her mask as she does, before reaching over to her wings and slowly starting to put the misplaced feathers back the way they were.</p>

<p>Looking up at the man, Seseri heaves a sigh before approaching the man once more, written note in hand.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Please be more careful with my feathers! I can feel from those, after all. Playing with them too roughly hurts.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Grug looks over the note. &quot;Oh, Grug sorry. Grug had no intention to harm you, smart little bird person.&quot; He drops the note on the ground sort of carelessly.

<p>Seseri simply lets him play with her feathers, letting out a barely audible as she starts to write down on her pad once more. <em>&quot;You know, where I'm from it's considered rude to play with another's feathers like this without permission.&quot;</em> Seseri chuckles softly. <em>&quot;It doesn't stop young chicks, though.

<p>Suddenly, Ami catches Grug's wild movements out of the corner of her eye, and she finds herself completely spellbound.</p>

<p><em>He can't be... a caveman??</em> she thinks to herself, leaning closer to get a better view.</p>

<p>Destiny Dude's expression is full of anger and grief, his hands are clenched in fists and between gritted teeth he says &quot;This must be a sick joke.&quot;. He spends some time eyeing his surroundings, the angry expression on his face combined with his dirty and tattered clothes are certainly not a good fit to the atmosphere of the room.</p>

<p>“A joke you say… yet I fail to see the humor in any of this.” The gentleman strolls next to Destiny Dude with a dismayed, pitiable look. After looking over the malcontent man and noticing his worn attire, Archibald speaks up. “It seems as if fate has not been kind to you. Whatever situation you must’ve been in prior to our abduction was a harsh one. You have my sympathies, lad.”</p>

<p>&quot;Fate has been much harsher on a lot more people than it has been to me.&quot; Destiny Dude looks to the floor.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems it hasn't been too bad on you...well, until now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We all seem to be in some of the worst places to exist in the universe right now.&quot;</p>

<p>“Looks can be deceiving, lad. Fate turned a blind eye to me more than once during my lifetime. Though I'd agree there are others who might have suffered more than either of us.” The Count muses grimly.</p>
<p>Archibald looks at the Destiny Dude. Their eyes don’t meet, as the latter continues to stare down the floor. Should he raise his head, he’d see the piercing eyes of the gentleman. “I’m aware you haven’t taken our situation well, and I perfectly understand why. However, we can only brood for so long. I’m sure that a fire should light up inside you soon. Use that passion to turn the tides in your favor. Just some advice, lad.”</p>

<p>He meets Archibald's gaze. &quot;And you are giving me that advice even though that means we could become foes in the near future?.&quot;</p>
<p>Destiny Dude looks at Grug and says in a whispering tone. &quot;...So that's how I must look to other people.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, being angry and doing nothing does no favors to anybody, I appreciate the concern, yet I could say it doesn't look like you are concerned enough about our situation here.&quot;</p>

<p>Archibald nonchalantly shrugs his shoulders. “I’d rather not resort to such presumptions. What matters is so long as this Maximilian wanker has us here against our say, we’re on equal footing as victims. Besides, advice goes beyond hostile or amiable relationships.”</p>
<p>“As for my concern,” elaborates the Count, “I’ve never been the type to wear my feelings on my sleeves. Such emotions I tend to exhibit internally as opposed to externally. Of course I give a damn about our situation! Who wouldn’t? I’m just not a man who tends to dwell on these things for too long.” He folds his arms and sighs. A chattering could be heard inside his coat.</p>

<p>Destiny Dude notices the sound coming from Archibald's robes and his eyes move toward his coat, but Dude doesn't inquire about it and just nods. &quot;That's good to hear, at least I know you are not a psychopath.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I would also rather we all maintain relatively good demeanors between each other, at least for as long as we can, as far as I understand none of us asked for this to happen.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I've heard as much from my elders over the years. I'm sure no one here imagined themselves to be in a position like this, though.&quot; She turns away from Dude, and her kimono swishes slightly. &quot;I'll be around if you ever want to chat some more~&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm glad to see I'm not the only one appalled at our current situation&quot;</p>
<p>Shul'N'Zuroth approaches the embittered man slowly, a cup off coffee clasped in both hands, he raises it to his lips, taking a sip before standing next to Destiny Dude.</p>
<p>&quot;Pleased to make your acquantaince. I'm Shul'N'Zuroth but you can call me Z&quot; He says a tentacle snaking outward as if offering a hand shake&quot;</p>

<p>Destiny Dude looks at the tentacle but he doesn't shake it.&quot;Who wouldn't be? they are treating to destroy whole planets just for their enjoyment...&quot; He takes a short a short pause before continuing. &quot;I'm not sure if I'm losing my mind or not, but knowing that not everybody is on board with this ridiculousness makes me feel like I am not a complete lost cause yet.&quot; his frowns turns into a melancholic faint smile for a second.</p>
<p>&quot;My name is not important, feel free to call me any way you want.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sorry but I am not sure how I should act while talking to things that...&quot; He glances at the tentacles peeking out from Z's form. &quot;...that are not human, I didn't even know there were other intelligent creatures besides just my species.&quot;</p>

<p>Z chuckles a bit, handing his coffee cup to one of his tentacles before grabbing his robe and lifting it up, revealing a mostly normal pair of legs and feet. Tentacles do continue to writhe and slither idly as you them originating from what must be his back</p>
<p>&quot;I am human if you'd believe it. Simply blessed by the Elder gods. Azathoth to be more precise as this is his gift. My family has spent their years devoted to his worship and...well his dreams. Do the Elder god's reach your world too?&quot;</p>

<p>He frowns his eyebrows a bit. &quot;Elder gods? I've only heard of stuff like this in fantasy and sci-fi stories....&quot; with a sigh he goes on. &quot;So this is a dream after all? ...I figured it was going to happen sooner or later, but to think that crazed hallucinations could feel so real.&quot;</p>
<p>Realizing he has been more talking to himself rather than answering Z's question he clears his throat. &quot; Uh, no. No Elder world has reached any world I know. But at this point I guess most of them have already been destroyed by humans...&quot; he shakes his head. &quot;No need for any power beyond my comprehension for that to happen, just plain old greed.&quot;</p>
<p>He looks at the tentacles again. &quot;If you don't mind, how did...&quot; He points at the tentacle. &quot;That happen?...you know, the Elder god thing.&quot;</p>

<p>Z's eyes light up a bit at the question gulping the last of his coffee down before handing the empty mug to his tentacles.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, my friend, as I mentioned it was a gift from the great ones, specifically Azathoth. In ancient times at the dawn of we were chosen by the old ones for a grand task&quot;</p>
<p>Z holds out his hands and a tentacle snakes from out of his robe to hand him a large aged scroll. Alien rune-like markings cover it and as he speaks you can see a faint light glow over them</p>
<p>&quot;Humanity would worship the Elder gods, and in return we would receive their gifts and blessings. Some families, like mine, decided to receive the greatest of gifts, a mixing of bloodlines and so Azathoth, the great dreamer's blood runs through my veins. These are a mark of his favor and love&quot;</p>

<p>Z takes a moment before taking a breath and stuffing the scroll back away in his robes</p>
<p>&quot;Please forgive me for that heh. I get a bit excited talking about the old one's and their history. It's been my life's work documenting it and deciphering their teachings and iconography.&quot;</p>

<p>He shakes his head. &quot;There's no need to apologize, I was the one who asked in the first place.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If your people got chosen for a grand task then how are these elder gods going to react to...whatever this is? from the looks of it your world may also be in danger.&quot;</p>

<p>Z yawns before nodding, agreeing with the sentiment as his tentacle snakes out from his robe pouring hot water from an electric kettle before another adds instant coffee and cream stirring it all together</p>
<p>&quot;I haven't the slightest clue how the Elder ones are reacting to all this...this all feels like a...I'd say dream but I'm all to familiar with dreams. This is a nightmare&quot;</p>
<p>Z sighs letting himself indulge in the warm cup of coffee before speaking again</p>
<p>&quot;I shudder to think how this will affect all our worlds, the innocent lives that are affected...and I dare not think about how I may never see my loved ones again...whatever the case this sick game is vile and disgusting. And I'll have no part of it if I can help it. Care for some coffee by the way? I've got tea as well.&quot;</p>
<p>Z offers as several other tentacles produce an additional mug and a box filled with packets of assorted teas and instant coffee</p>

<p>Destiny Dude takes a deep breath. &quot;If this is a dream, I suppose there is no point on being angry the whole time; it's been a long time since the last time I tasted some good coffee, thank you for the offer.&quot; He reaches for the mug accepting the invitation. &quot;I hope I'm not prying to much in asking how your world is, you mentioned loved ones and you seem like a well mannered person, so I assume it is a nice place to live in.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not at all! We're thriving in fact&quot; The tentacles reach out offering sugar and cream while filling the mug with hot coffee</p>
<p>&quot;The Elder gods certainly don't look a thing like us, nor do their offspring but they've given humanity a variety wonderful gifts. Technology that we've taken and improved upon over the years. That's why we have things like this. Just need to make sure they stay juiced up&quot;</p>
<p>Z says knocking on the side of the electric kettle before reaching into his robe before producing a small vial. You can see now on closer examination it's made of a strange bone-like material with grooves and edges carved into it. A swirl in the center of this glows red, which Z starts to fill as he opens the vial letting the thick viscous liquid poor into the cracks. The symbols and grooves start to fill and glow as if sucking up the liquid til all the grooves are full again.</p>
<p>Z puts the vial back into his robe as the tentacles slink back into his robe hidden away again</p>
<p>&quot;Just gotta keep a little bit of blood on you to keep the small stuff running&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Blood is an...uh, interested fuel source.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I guess if your people are doing well there's nothing much to complain.&quot; He sips from his coffee cup. &quot;Maybe it is because the last time I drank coffee was several years ago, but this really does taste good.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you I'm glad you enjoy it. It's a blend of my own creation.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As for blood well it is necessary with the tools we were given by the old ones. It's not human blood...at least not usually. But most things are powered by goats blood in my world. Even our trains have a car dedicated to them in case they run out.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But they're all the same, the same as those who came before them, and whose foolish actions have pushed humanity, at least on our galaxy, to the brink of extinction...&quot;</p>

<p>Henry looks around at his extravagant surroundings, bewilderment visible on his face for only a moment, and then it's gone. In its place a deep frown forms in a swift, practiced motion. He scans the room briefly before sitting down, laying his golf club horizontally on his lap.  He searches his pockets, and pulls out a cigar. He doesn't light it yet, instead playing with it between his fingers. His frown somehow becomes deeper still, now bordering on a scowl, but there's a glint of something in his eyes.</p>
<p>Excitement, perhaps?</p>

<p>Grug sniffs the air, several times. &quot;Grug smells many new scents... unfamiliar, excit-&quot; he suddenly coughs repeatedly. &quot;Grug does not like that one!&quot; He coughs hard, and waves his hand in front of his face. He's nearby Hoover, but looking in a different direction.</p>

<p>Henry whips his head around to the caveman, roused from his thoughts. It takes him a second to realise that Grug it talking about the cigar.</p>
<p>“Sorry, they take some getting used to.” He says, with a plastic smile.</p>
<p>He takes the cigar out of his mouth, and spins it around on his fingers, careful to not touch the lit end. Henry smiles more genuinely, proud of his little party trick.</p>
<p>“I take it you’re Grug?” Henry puts the cigar back into his mouth and extends a hand. “You can have one, if you want.”</p>
<p>Henry laughs as if the thought amuses him greatly.</p>

<p>Taking noticed of the disgruntled man’s countenance, Archibald walks over to Henry. “I don’t blame your bad mood. This predicament this Maximilian chap thrust upon us is unsettling to say the least.” Something seems to occur within the Count and his eyes narrow. “You look… familiar. As if I saw you on a cover of a magazine or tabloid. Perhaps I’m losing  my marbles but…”</p>
<p>He notices the golf clubs. “Aha! You must be a professional golfer. How many series have you won?”</p>

										</div>										<div class='conversation-post-body'>
<p>Henry’s eyes snap up, pulled away from his thoughts. His hard-set frown melts into a warm smile as he laughs, tickled by some inside joke. “None yet, friend. And I’m no professional, I only got into golf over a pissing contest with my favourite person to annoy.”</p>
<p>Henry’s eyes quickly scan Archibald up and down, as if taking inventory of something.</p>
<p>“And I have been in more magazines than I can count, so who knows?” Henry’s signature frown returns once more, tugging slightly at the corners of his lips. “Although, I get the feeling that you and I are from very different places”</p>
<p>He extends a hand: “Name’s Henry. Henry Hoover. A pleasure”</p>

										</div>										<div class='conversation-post-body'>
<p>“Cheers! Count Archibald Don Castro. The feeling is mutual.” He gently shakes the hand of Henry. The mention of Henry having a rival amuses the gentleman. “Now I get it! It’s your way of sticking it to the man. That I can respect. There are many people I wish to bring down a peg or two. Everyone in that bloody Midas Club. Frivolous corrupt simpletons. <em>ahem</em>” He catches himself going on a potential tangent and clears his throat.</p>
<p>The Count nods. “I concur. We are unlikely to come from the same place. That said, perhaps where we come from only has minor differences compared to the other guests here.” Appearing intrigued, Archibald rests his hand in his chin. “So, if golfing is merely a hobby yet you’re notorious enough to be on magazines, what might your true profession?”</p>

										</div>										<div class='conversation-post-body'>
<p>Henry coughs awkwardly and breaks eye-contact for the first time.</p>
<p>“I sell vacuum cleaners.” He says, growing a bit quieter than before. “I made a shitload of money and I never managed to find anything significant to spend it on, so I mostly used my funds to be a general nuisance”</p>
<p>Henry finally lights his cigar and draws on it, letting the smoke fill his lungs for a few seconds before letting it out through his nose. He closes his eyes, enjoying the familiarity of it.</p>
<p>“I suppose all that money isn’t going to help me here, and I severely doubt blondie over there accepts cheques” He says with a small chuckle, jabbing his thumb over his shoulder towards Maximilian vont Blitz.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter though, I have… other skills” Henry smiles genuinely, clearly reliving some fond memory. “But enough about me, what about you? You seem to be part of the upper crust as well. Do you find it as mind numbingly boring as I do?”</p>

<p>“Selling vacuums? I see. Those sure must’ve been some expensive appliances if you could earn a fortune from that.” He smirks, but still looks genuinely impressed. “As a fellow man of wealth, it came to me primarily by inheritance. My grandfather Bertram Don Castro pioneered the steam travel industry with easy to obtain locomotives. The profits were passed down to my father and then me once he passed away.”</p>
<p>The Count ponders Henry’s question while scratching his sideburns. “Boring? Hmmm, yes and no. I don’t regret my fortune. I <strong>do</strong> however resent other aristocrats. They tend to be some of the most pretentious, corrupt, cowardly ne’er do wells I’ve come to know!”</p>
<p>“You know, I respect you Henry.” He folds his arms with an approving nod. “You say it how it is. Regardless of how petty your motives might be, at least you actually do something with your spare time. I never have respect for other fat cats who lay on their nest egg just to hold a position in power. Or worse, they aid in a useless bureaucracy. Someday…”  He halts and shakes his head. Once composed, his expression now looks bitter and disgusted.</p>

										</div>										<div class='conversation-post-body'>
<p>Henry’s eyes light up with surprise, and his smile grows wider, into something more genuine than before. It looks unnatural on his face, it’s obvious Henry does not smile often.</p>
<p>“And here I was worried we wouldn’t get along. I hate snooty pricks in their glass towers! I’d pay good money to see them torn down.” Henry’s grip on his golf club tightens.</p>
<p>“I have, on occasion.” he adds, with a predatory glint in his eye.</p>
<p>Henry turns his attention to his solid gold wristwatch, and he takes it off, dangling it in front of Archibald’s face. “I only bought this stupid watch because it’s the only one of its kind. Something about the clockmaker dying as he made it. It’s the sort of shit my ‘friends’ would have a seizure over.”</p>
<p>Henry holds up the watch up to his own face, a faint yellow reflection visible as the watch catches the light.</p>
<p>“It’s awful. It’s ugly and heavy and doesn’t even tell the time properly. So I bought it. I find it quite the adequate description of the ‘aristocrat’ life; expensive, useless and an eyesore to anyone in their right mind.”</p>
<p>Henry puts the watch back on. “It also pissed off that asshole Greg Barbour more than you can possibly imagine. Especially once he learned I don’t even take it off when I shower.”</p>

										</div>										<div class='conversation-post-body'>
<p>Archibald looks at the watch intently. There doesn’t seem to be any enthusiasm nor disinterest in his reaction. “That’s certainly a watch. I’ve never been the sort to buy fancy goods for the mere sake of it. I prefer more… philanthropic investments. Even so, the fact you succeeded in getting a rise out of your foes is a riot! I can only imagine the priceless look on their faces!” The gentleman snickers at the thought.</p>

										</div>										<div class='conversation-post-body'>
<p>Henry’s smile falters slightly.</p>
<p>“Once you have enough money, ‘for the sake of it’ is the only reason you have to spend it.”</p>
<p>Henry pauses, as if unsure of something.</p>
<p>“450 billion pounds.” He emphasises the ‘b’ in billion. “You can’t even wrap your head around such a stupid number. That’s more than the number of stars in the galaxy. At least the one where I’m from.”</p>
<p>Henry’s gaze hardens, and he looks warily back at the count after snapping out of his tangent.</p>
<p>“A philanthropist. I’ve met more than my share of philanthropists in my life. What do you spend your wealth on?”</p>

<p>Mrs Kitchener stares intently at Mr Hoover as she slowly makes her way towards him.

<p>“Name’s Henry Hoover, and I’m sorry to say that I don’t carry an ounce of authority here.” Henry laughs, but it’s pretty clear to see that he’s a bit bitter about this. “I’m pretty clueless. I’ve mostly been passing the time by talking to random people.”</p>

<p>Henry opens the mysterious envelope and reads what's inside. His eyebrows arch.
&quot;Huh.&quot; He says, but has no further reaction.
He thinks for a bit, scratching is nose.

<p>&quot;Ohoho!&quot; Mrs Kitchener laughs, slowly reaching up and lightly prodding Barbatos' forearm. &quot;I'm sure your parents are very pleased, always finishing your plate.&quot;</p>
<p>She turns her head and scans left and right.
&quot;Tell me, dearie, could you help out an old woman and let me know what's going on? I must say, I'm not so caught up on recent events are perhaps I ought to be.&quot;</p>

<p>Not long after Barbatos starts eating the protein brick, Seseri lands next to him, from the front so as to not surprise him.

<p>She inspects it from its spot in his hand, looking at it from various angles, letting out a frightful &quot;fweet&quot; as she does.
This time, she hands him two pieces of paper instead of one. One depicts a crudely drawn head next to Barbatos' Brick Bar, and the other the writing:
<em>&quot;By the spring! That thing's almost as big as my head! How do you even eat that?&quot;</em></p>

<p>&quot;All more reason for you to watch what you eat. I certainly must in my professions...hence why I make my own food.&quot;</p>

<p>Of all the people forced to participate in the prisoner death game, the sight of the old woman made Harrow’s blood boil. The way her eyes squinted, her voice mumbling something about sleep and tea, made the ex-centurion feel pity for this unfortunate granny. Could she even…<em>see?</em> See well enough to protect herself from the events to come, or even worse, enough that she could transcribe exactly what the letters told them all? Did she have any idea what was going on or what was most likely about to happen to her? That these coming days were to be a literal fight for one's planet, not just saving your own soul, but the life and safety of everyone you love back home? How…how could someone from any corner of the universe find pleasure and joy in making someone like <em>her</em> fight for their own life? Harrow had heard tales of ancient god’s on her own world, some of which were considered evil, but she never really believed they existed. But now…she wasn’t so sure.</p>
<p>The woman cautiously steps toward the frail figure, trying to make herself appear as gentle as possible, but finding it hard to hide the scowl on her lips.</p>
<p>“Excuse me, ma’am? Are you…are you alright?! Do you know why you are here?” She spoke in a slightly louder octave than normal to be sure the woman could hear her correctly, placing a kind blackened left hand on the woman's forearm.</p>

As I walked back to my house, I just... ended up here! This is not the circumstance I had hoped for, to say the least... but I suppose we have to make the best out of a grim situation?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, rather quite! Best for us to keep positive for now, I'm sure as dreadful as this situation is, it's not quite so dreary as studying, hoho. Though I admit, it's certainly been a while since my schoolgirl days.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, well...&quot;</p>
<p>Juliana stops being so talkative for a moment.
&quot;Well, they <em>are</em> now. Now that the war is over, you see. Once it was all over, they said I wasn't a threat and just put me in a home. Yes, it's ever so... tranquil now.&quot;</p>
<p>She sighs, then perks up again.
&quot;Oh, but I shouldn't regail you with such tragic stories. Why, I should think we have enough on our plates as it is! I'm glad to have such an accomplished young woman on this ship, it makes me feel far more secure.&quot;</p>

<p>She chuckles and waves nervously, as if to dismiss Juliana teasingly. &quot;And I am hardly accomplished, but thank you for the compliment! Actually, having you around makes me feel more secure as well. You seem to have a good head on your shoulders.&quot;</p>

<p>Mrs Kitchener's maternal instincts kick in immediately, despite the circumstances.
&quot;Your daughter is missing? How frightful! Children do have a way of going missing, don't they? I remember, one time my children played hide and seek, and one of them got stuck inside of a rose bush for hours! She was so worried I would make a fuss that she kept quiet the whole time, the silly girl.&quot;
She looks around, wistfully.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, we shouldn't fret too much, I'm sure one of the staff will run into her sooner or later and realise. Assuming she shares your...&quot;
She adjusts her glasses and peers down.

<p>Janeet nods slightly. The back of the chair moving forward as if its her head. &quot;Its nice to meet you Juliana. And you would be right we all look like... well chairs. What is more jarrin is seeing your furniture walking and talking. But I suppose its oppisites. In I guess my planet? Humans are our furniture. So it must be strange for you to see your furniture moving.&quot; She then huffs in amusement. &quot;And its no issue Juliana.&quot; She says with a warm smile. &quot;We still do shake hands.&quot; She then moves her right arm and what looks like a hand in mittens starts to push through the fabric and stops half way out. As if a person was stuck inside a chair shaped prison trying to escape.</p>

&quot;Yes, quite the menagerie, but I suppose it is more interesting than staring at the telly, after all.&quot;

<p>Juliana is lost in thought for a moment, trying to piece things together.
That peculiar man said something about our earths? I would say I live in a normal world, though I admit, I haven't exactly travelled to many others.&quot; she chuckles.
&quot;Everything is so calm and peaceful, now that the war is over. Not many young folks left to cause a... ruckus.&quot;</p>
<p>As she talks, her voice begins to adopt a more reserved and nostalgic tone, but it picks up soon after she finishes.</p>

<p>Z sips his coffee again before staring deeply into the dark black liquid seemingly lost in thought. He takes another sip before continuing</p>
<p>&quot;We seem to be aboard a space craft of sorts all part of a game orchestrated by that man on the throne and his cohorts who claim to have conquered all our worlds.&quot;</p>
<p>Z's tentacles stir a bit as one comes out adding cream to his coffee before slinking back into the robe</p>
<p>&quot;The winner of this...sick little game...will be rewarded with a continued and prosperous existence. The losers... well I suppose those destroyed are a small cost for 'perfection&quot; Z says with an embittered tone, eyes narrowed with a angry scowl on his face,</p>

&quot;I was hoping he was just using emphatic language. I can see why everyone is in such a miserable state.
She sighs.
&quot;You know, I had rather been hoping that the worst was behind me when they put me away, but duty calls. I just hope that man comes to his senses and calls off such a dreadful event.&quot;</p>

<p>Shul'n'Zuroth explores the grand halls of the extravagant space station with both wonder and worry. His curiosity guides him to each corner of the room, eyeing the large artifacts, quizzically watching the other guests at this ball before finally finding a small couch to rest on. Still holding his cup, he passes his coffee to one of his tentacles, his features and expression seeming to soften a bit as the tentacle disappears into his robes, only for several more to come out producing a large quilt that covers him all the way to the floor. Holding the quilt with his hands, one of his tentacles proceeds to move the needle through a new patch with the speed an ease of a sewing machine, guided by his two hands. Patches seem to depict primarily children that look similar to him, as well as a beautiful woman doing different activities together, while others show alien like creatures and even horrors doing mundane tasks such as office work or playing soccer.</p>

<p>Grug finds himself next to the strange man, and looks at him with excited eyes. &quot;What are you making? How? What is that?&quot; As he says this last part he suddenly and swiftly reaches out one hand with the intent of grabbing a tentacle.</p>

<p>Z makes no sudden movements still working on his quilt as the tentacle Grug is reaching for suddenly slithers back into Z's robes. turning to face the large cave man, Z gives a smile as his tentacles all retreat into his robes. &quot;My you're a lively one! Well this is my family Quilt that I'm sewing&quot; Z says holding it up proudly &quot;And these are a part of me&quot;</p>
<p>Z's smile widens his eyes seemingly closed from the large smirk as all at once a large mass of tentacles snake out from all angles writhing and reaching in different directions. The lengths all vary between a few short fat ones to more slender tendrils reaching what must be at least 10 feet up.</p>
<p>Z sips his coffee with a sigh of contentment before pulling his tentacles back down, only a few remaining as one reaches out to grug as if a hand shake &quot;I'm Z. It's a pleasure, Mister...?&quot;</p>

<p>As the tentacles shoot out from him, the caveman yelps and leaps backwords. &quot;Wh-what are those? Weeds? Are you made of... weeds?&quot; He suddenly seems much less interested in grabbing the tentacle. &quot;Grug is... Grug.&quot;</p>

<p>The tentacle is warm and rubbery similar to an octopus and simply glides against grug's hand.</p>
<p>&quot;I am. Just different just like you're different from everyone else too. that's what makes us special. Would you like a snack?&quot; Z thinking better than giving this man coffee, has one of his tentacles reach out and offer grub a small chocolate cookie that would normally go with coffee.</p>

<p>&quot;What a strange texture Grug has never felt before,&quot; Grug says, as he places a second hand on the tentacle and begins to rub it speedily.</p>
<p>&quot;A snack? What... what food is this?&quot; He releases the tentacle, and extends one hand out towards the cookie.</p>

<p>Grug cautiously accepts the cookie. He raises it to his faces, rotating it to get views of all sides of the cookie, sniffing at it. He takes a small nibble- <em>(is it a normal cookie?)</em></p>

<p>From several feet away, Ami studies Z as he works on the quilt, the movement of the tentacles almost hypnotic to her. Before she knows it, she's approached him curiously. &quot;I haven't seen tentacles quite like that on a person before, and I know <em>plenty</em> of octopus and squidfolk back home,&quot; she giggles. &quot;But pardon my manners! Is there a story you're crafting here on this quilt, by chance?&quot;</p>

<p>Z looks up from the quilt to see the woman standing in front of him, his tentacles still working. Studying the mushroom atop her...no...part of her head? He gives her a quizzical look before shaking his head back and forth and giving a tired smile</p>
<p>&quot;A story of sorts yes. This is one of my family quilts I've been working on. I put on patches of either friends or family and events going on in our lives.&quot;</p>
<p>A tentacle wraps around Z's body before handing his empty hands a cup of coffee. He takes a sip before recoiling a bit from the heat</p>
<p>&quot;ah bit hot haha. As for my form well they are quite unique tentacles. They're a gift from Azathoth. But I'm forgetting my manners as hell heh. I'm Shul'N'Zuroth and what might I call you, Miss Mushroom?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ami - Ami Muscaria,&quot; she replies, giving Z a brief wave. &quot;I'd shake your hand, but parts of my skin are toxic, heh.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is Azathoth... an entity, then? I've never heard of them.&quot;</p>

<p>Z offers an outstretched tentacle at the comment of toxic skin</p>
<p>&quot;My tentacles are fortunately immune to toxins and the like. A gift of a great ones indeed. Regarding Azathoth, yes he is the greatest of all the Great old Gods. It's his dreams that shape and move our reality. Our world is upheld by his thoughts. It's been my lifes work dreaming with him and deciphering their meanings.&quot;</p>
<p>Z scoffs suddenly before saying &quot;where are my manners? Ami would you like tea or coffee to drink?&quot;</p>
<p>Suddenly several tentacles of Z's snake out holding an electric kettle a box with a variety of teas and instant coffees, as well as a mug</p>

<p>Ami reaches out and shakes a tentacle a bit cautiously, as she's not used to being able to make much physical contact with people anymore.</p>

<p>&quot;I would love to have some tea and learn more about your Old Gods. I wonder if we've encountered them where I'm from and we just haven't realized it yet, what with all the strange happenings over the past few decades...&quot;</p>

<p>Z's eyes light up as Ami inquires about the Old Ones. Packing away the quilt and supplies his tentacles offer her a warm cup of water with an option of tea bags before Z slows his thoughts.</p>
<p>&quot;You believe you may have come across the Elders? Tell me just what are these strange happenings in your world that you're referring to?&quot;</p>

<p>Ami selects a bag of what she presumes to be herbal tea and makes herself a cup. The warmth is refreshing and familiar, and she sighs deeply.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, about 30 years ago, a team of scientists discovered a strange alien object in the middle of a desert. After a couple years of research, the box-like object actually opened and - believe it or not - the entire Earth became Altered over the course of a few years. The atmosphere became toxic, people started mutating, wildlife developed incredible qualities! It was amazing and horrifying, from what I've heard from older generations who witnessed the Altering firsthand. We still don't know who or what dropped the alien box, though.&quot;</p>

										</div>										<div class='conversation-post-body'>
<p>Z at this point has started writing down what you're saying, notating the details on a scroll while a tentacle lifts a mug to his lips.</p>
<p>&quot;Fascinating. From what you've told me it doesn't sound like any influence of the Eldritch type. Though I must admit you're not the first person I've ever met who had a mushroom head...or body. The Elder Gods certainly work on mysterious ways!&quot;</p>
<p>Putting the notes away a tentacle hands Z another scroll this one covered in strange runes and writings. Unfurling it the runes behind to glow and Z begins to chant in a strange alien like tongue. Suddenly the scroll portrays a hologram depicting what out of character you'd know as Cthulhu reaching down towards humans and handing them relics.</p>
<p>&quot;In the beginning when humans gained sentience they were chosen by the Great old ones to worship them and in return secrets of the universe would be unveiled. They gave us the technology we use from our cars to our trains a well as may gifts such as these&quot; he says as his tentacles flex as if they were biceps.</p>
<p>&quot; My life's work has been deciphering the dreams of the greatest old god
,Azathoth the dreamer. Each night in my sleep I dream for what can feel like years and decipher and unveil meaning or teaching from the great one. I had hoped to awaken the slumbering god but...well given the game at hand perhaps that'll never happen.&quot;</p>
<p>Z looks wistfully at the hologram before stuffing away the scroll</p>

<p>&quot;still I am glad there are friendly faces around. I would sit and talk with everyone for an eternity if it meant no one had to die.&quot;</p>

<p>Z gives a soft smile to Ami, rustling a bit getting more comfortable before pulling out the quilt to work on again &quot; What about yourself what was your role at home&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, at home, I studied horticulture with several other plantfolk in my neighborhood. My best friend and I ended up devoting many years to researching fungi in particular, looking into the ramifications they could have on our health. It's modest work, really, heheh.&quot;</p>

<p>Ami takes a particularly deep sip from her cup of tea, and anyone looking closely at her face in that moment would be able to catch a small glimpse of a dark, almost insect-like eye peeking from beneath the rim of the mushroom cap.</p>

<p>&quot;on the contrary any research into the betterment of others is noble work.&quot;</p>
<p>Z takes a heavy gulp of his coffee before giving a yawn and looking with heavy thought at the cup.</p>
<p>&quot; My wife once thought that just because her work in archaeology was such a small blip in the universe we're in it didnt matter. But without her I never would have made it to the position I'm in with her discoveries. No matter how small our actions may seem the ripple we make in the world has consequences. Sounds like yours were made for the better.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Archaeology and the decryption of runes. The ruins of our world were there for millennium before humans had even come to be. The runes on iconography and the lost civilizations of old held knowledge that would benefit not just the Elder Gods but humanity as well.

<p>Henry looks over Zee’s shoulder, eyebrow quirked.</p>
<p>“Impressive” He says, with equal parts disgust and fascination. “I’ve seen machines work slower.”</p>
<p>Henry slings his golf club over his shoulder, not quite stomaching the thought of sitting down next to Zee, but making it clear he does not intend to leave anytime soon.</p>
<p>“These… tentacles, they’re a part of your body? Their coordination’s amazing”</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you. Why yes as a matter of fact they are. They were a gift from the Great elder God, Azathoth for many many generations of worship. I'm sorry I don't believe we've met. I'm Shul'N'Zuroth, but you can call me Z. Would you like some tea or coffee?&quot;</p>
<p>As if on que several other tentacles snake out of the large robe holding an open box of instant coffee and tea, an electric kettle and an empty mug, the last of which another tentacle polishes with a rag</p>

<p>Henry’s eyes widen slightly, and he takes a step back, keeping his distance.</p>
<p>“Neither. Thanks, though.” He says, while gently pushing away the closest tentacle with the end of his golf club. Finally working up the nerve, he sits down on the far end of the couch, and gets comfortable.</p>
<p>“Sorry, I’m just not used to being the least interesting person in the room.” Henry gives Z a wry smile. “I’m Henry. Henry Hoover. I don’t suppose you’ve heard of me?”</p>
<p>It’s clear by the way Henry delivers his question that he already knows the answer.</p>

<p>“You’re observant. I’m a worldwide celebrity back home.” Henry’s smile fades as he stares wistfully at the colourful cast of characters around him.</p>
<p>“I’m rich too, could you tell?” He flashes his gold wristwatch at Z and laughs. “Ridiculously so. Back on my Earth that gives you a free pass on everything. Ultimate power.”</p>
<p>Henry stands up, once again slinging his golf club over his shoulder.</p>
<p>“But with ultimate power comes ultimate boredom. Ask your gods. I started doing illegal shit just to see if anyone would stop me, but no one ever did. The law may be blind but it still has bills to pay, I suppose.”</p>
<p>Henry sighs, almost offers Z his hand to shake, thinks better of it, and opts simply to wave before walking away.</p>
<p>“I’ll leave you to it, enjoy your coffee.” He calls over his shoulder, before mixing once more with the crowd.</p>

<p>Xerio still in complete disbelief of this whole scene looks immediately towards a bar. He gives slight nods and smiles to everyone that greets him until he reaches the bar and asks for a whiskey no rocks. It appears in front of him as he downs it and asks for 2 more. The liquor courses down through his body, his chest, to his stomach, and he lets it take him away from the stress briefly.
<em>Okay, wow, alright, okay, wow</em> He thinks to himself, <em>This is real and this is fine</em>.
He lets out a sigh and chuckles to himself, * I can work with this...No. I will work with this, this is actually pretty damn perfect.*
He downs his other drinks and proceeds to greet others and learn more. A brilliant smile and a pocket full of one liners he proceeds to schmooze the crowd.</p>

										</div>										<div class='conversation-post-body'>
<p>In a room -a ship- full of entities both unusually unique and familiarly humanoid, only one stood out to her as something potentially discernable. The sight gave Harrow a moment's pause, a brief blink of shock crossing her face when her sensors insisted there was something…metal to the man's build. <em>Is he…one of mine?</em> She asks herself, her feet traveling the distance across the room hurriedly toward the bar, the questions multiplying the closer she got and the faster she moved. A glint of wishful hope lit in her chest when she came up behind him, staring at his backside, analyzing. Up close, he was seemingly no more than a striking human man, but she could have sworn, even now, the sounds of screws twisting and cybernetics beeping lived underneath his skin. Or…was she mistaken? Was her own grasp on reality faltering to such a degree that her sensors picked up her own cybernetics, falsely implanting them on the first person she subconsciously wanted to connect with?</p>
<p>Maybe that is all it was. Maybe this person was not what she wished for, but Harrow had already made the trip here. Backing out now would seem…odd. Besides, even if it was just her panicked machine needing to cling to <em>something</em> to make all this seem real -it picked him for a reason. And Harrow had to know why.</p>
<p>She hesitated momentarily, almost wanting to grab him by the shoulder, turn him around and ask him flat out, but she controlled herself. Instead, she leaned against the bar next to him and spoke calmly, staring him in the eyes, &quot;forgive me if this seems unusual, but…do you know who I am? I think…&quot; She pauses, licking her lips, &quot;-you just look like a, uhm, a <em>centurion</em> I once knew it all&quot;. She prods him with the word, waiting to see if it sparks any resemblance on his face.</p>

<p>I notice her make her way across the room. Carefully but, smoothly avoiding others like it it was second nature. Sure a little push here or asking someone to move aside there to make it seem normal. My body wants to be on alert, but it's a party and they said no harm would come to anyone. Going with the flow I tell another joke to an individual as they reach the bar.</p>
<p>I turn to look at her and see someone like me, not exactly like me, but similar enough that I don't need to have that extra layer up. I take a moment to look and she is striking, and even more so she looks like she is someone who has seen battle many times. Lean, muscular, tall, and most likely deadly, there is a hint of what sounds like hope in her voice as she asks her question. I get it.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sorry...I think you may have mistaken me for someone else.&quot;  I say, &quot; I apologize for maybe making you think that way and not too sure what a <em>centurion</em> is...&quot;</p>
<p>I let the words hang for a second, being blunt sucks, but it is something that is needed sometimes.</p>
<p>&quot;But I'm Xerio.&quot; I say while holding out my hand, &quot; I may not be the friend you were looking for, but I would like to become your friend and help you with finding yours if you'd like.&quot;</p>

<p><em>Friend</em>. No, he certainly wasn’t from Eternity City, not if he was using connotations like ‘friend’ so loosely. There was hardly a hint of malice or suspiciousness to his tone, only an eager and kind infection that surprised her with its sincerity. Perhaps…he too could recognize the similarities to himself in her? In how they were built that is. Maybe…if not from the same world, they had earths akin to one another's. Perhaps there could be a kindred familiarity shared between the two based on this fact. Something they could trust, could comprehend. Or perhaps it was foolish of <em>her</em> to think such a thing. If she understood correctly, this was to be an ultimate death game of sorts. If he <em>was</em> really like her, then he too would be putting his own charlatan persona forward, attempting to break through her walls of security and self-protection to overcome the opponent underneath.</p>
<p>Or…maybe <em>she</em> was the one so used to her home, that genuine acts of humanity were automatically met with suspicion. Just because this was a death game didn’t mean there couldn't be alternate possibilities where multiple people could survive, if they played their cards right, despite what the rules stated, …Right?</p>
<p>Harrow was sure of one thing. If Xerio was actually built in the ways she thought he was, she wanted him on her side. The two of them together could be a force that none here would dare reckon with. And, truth be told, the mere fact that they were potentially similar in ways known only to eachother, made her gaze soften when she looked to him.</p>

<p>She meets his hand, a firm blackened left palm grasping his. “Friends, hm,” She smiles, eyes glancing down for a moment, finding his openness endearing, “It’s nice to meet you Xerio. My name…” a thought crossed her mind, eyes shifting unassuredly, worridely, “...is Harrow.” Now it looked like she had to think of what her own name was. “I, sorry-” a sheepish chuckle, “-I just didn’t think I would find someone like you here -like me- well that is to say…” Harrow trails off. She lowers her voice for her next question.</p>
<p>“Forgive me if I am being too forward, but do you happen to be part cybertronic? It's -i know it's an odd question- I only ask because I too have computer parts built inside me…<em>enhancements</em> and such.” She spoke that last word as an emphasis toward her usefulness, should he truly want to become <em>friends</em>, she felt he should be aware up front about what she could bring to the table.</p>

<p>She is like a wolf without a pack, careful and suspicious of every thing I could say and do. She did though take a step toward to the line of friendship by telling me what she is and I can respect that and honor it. I am who I am now and not who I was before.</p>
<p>As she tell him that she also has enhancements, Xerio lets his eyes flip through their different settings showing them flicker through a rainbow of colors and functions, &quot; You are not wrong Harrow, I also have many...<em>enhancements</em>&quot; I don't hide the slight disdain of them from my tones, &quot; More than just my eyes as well as you can probably assume and I appreciate the openness about this as well, though I must say we should discuss these things in a less...populated environment considering the game we are in.&quot;</p>
<p>I take a long sip of my drink and ask in a louder tone with a smirk &quot; So want to compare dystopias? I feel like my mega corporation towers have to out number yours by at least a dozen.&quot;</p>

<p>Harrow pleasently smiles at Xerio. She watches the myriad of colors -settings most likely- dance across his eyes, wondering what they all mean. Determined to find out, she nods wholeheartedly at his innocation of privacy. &quot;Hm, yes. I believe later there may be a possability for us to slip away and find someplace more intimate, away from prying ear's and eyes-discuss how our unique builds could help one another. Plans of action on how to use them even. Also, genuinely, the makeup of cybertronics interests me. Even in all my years, it seems I still come -or came- across people who have settings I've never heard of,&quot; a laugh comes from her lips, amused. &quot;There might be concepts from your computer makeup that I've never heard of before from my earth.&quot; She gives Xerio an interested grin once more.</p>
<p>Perhaps she was too harsh on him before when she pressumed him slightly naive. This was indeed a good idea, it showed a sense of self preservation and responsability to the man that Harrow liked. It seemed to Harrow like he saw as much of an advantage in a union with her, as she did with him.</p>
<p>&quot;Compare dystopia's?&quot; She muses, turning her body so that her elbows rested on the counter backwards, the front of her form facing the party hall beyond. There was a distant look in her eye as she continue's. &quot;Actually, mine isn't a <em>dystopia</em>, its a '<em>utiopia</em>'-&quot; an angitated scoff snorts from ner nostrils, &quot;-or so thats what the people in power like to call it, but those of us forced to live in the underbelly of the city, well, we see it differently.&quot; Harrow shakes her head heaving a heavy sigh. Turning toward Xerio to face him once again, eyes looking into his, she says, &quot;I assume your's is the same way...only it sounds like they dont try to hide it as our's does?&quot;</p>

										</div>										<div class='conversation-post-body'>
<p>Xerio laughs &quot; Of course I would be more than happy to discuss our unique builds somewhere more private. It's always a pleasure to meet someone else with interests who align with my own.</p>
<p>Xerio is glad to have met someone who he can genuinely relate with and who seems to have his same sense of the situation we are in. Either the liquor or company has made him feel more at ease with everything going on.</p>
<p>&quot;Ha! Oh yes those of us walking on the ground get a obviously clear view of the towering skyscrapers and flying vehicles that the <em>upper crust</em> live. We see their beautifully colored faces on screens talking of this and that which don't concern us down below.&quot; His gaze gets distant while talking of all of this.</p>
<p>He continues,&quot; Those of us on the ground floor fight and struggle every day, not knowing the feel of safety in your home, nor the taste of food that is freshly cooked, hell we don't even get quiet from the sounds unless you make your way deep under the ground...&quot;</p>

&quot;Hmm, Xerio, you say? is that a common name on your Earth? I must admit, it sounds like something out of a science fiction book to me, haha!&quot;</p>
<p>She chuckles warmly, her mood softening from before.

<p>He takes a small sip and looks back at Mrs. Kitchener
&quot; Haha, well lets just say my parents were inspired by a science fiction or two when they named me. I'll be honest you seem to be taking everything going on fairly well just casually dropping <em>your Earth</em> and all that. Not phased in the slightest?&quot;
&quot;I'll also add that hey its never too late to change it, any thoughts with all these new exciting inspirations all around us Juliana?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Haha, yes, this cast of characters really does get the old imagination whirring, doesn't it? I shant think I'll go too crazy, but perhaps I might change it to something like Victoria, although... well, I'd Not be able to Order my usual magazines.&quot;</p>
<p>She smiles and moves in a little closer.
&quot;Why, do you have any ideas?&quot;</p>

<p>Chuckling Xerio says, &quot; I mean I could think of a few, but considering our current situation and how things go I think Julianna is a name worthy of the stars that all deserve to see.&quot;</p>
<p>He takes a sip of his tea and sighs, &quot; The magazines though I feel can maybe be swapped around considering all our new options.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Julianna I must ask, what are your thoughts on our very current situation. I would hate to see a kind soul such as yourself go through anything possibly difficult.&quot;</p>

<p>A bird woman. A talking chair. A tory that kept talking to his sleeve. Victoria Rolfe closes her eyes and attempts to dull the cacophany of unfamiliar noises and visuals. Not a single one of these aliens are familiar to her. In her line of work, it's better to be afraid of unpreparedness than bullets and right now she couldn't help but feel the grip of anxiety on her throat.
<em>Perhaps it's a fever dream.
No.</em>
She ruled out the possibility.
Her brain would never expect her to engage in small talk.</p>

<p>Harrow’s frame remains frozen. Fighting against the movement of bodies -of time- flowing around her, appearing almost non vacant. Like a statue hidden in the shadows, its haunting gaze seeming to follow everyone and everything all at once, only her eyes move. She carefully studies the room, listening to the conversations of those addressing the man up high who believes himself the god over all their lives. Every emotion she was weighed with before awakening, the panic, fear, loss, and brief glimpse of hope, are forcibly buried down underneath the boot of the soldier persona taking her mind hostage. Numbness sets in and only three thoughts remain, repeating themselves momentarily, a desperate anchor dragging along the depths trying to cling to something solid - something known. <em>Kill…survive…escape.</em></p>
<p>Claws from her blackened hand start slowly inching from sheathed fingers, acting on these words as if it were a command, but Harrow retracts them. It was a dangerous situation, her body responding to the familiar mantra from the inherently violent part of her system, instead of listening to the sentience inside the machine who wished to forget that part of herself entirely. She could see it now, letting loose, slashing and disemboweling every biological and mechanical obstacle in the room…but to what end? A foolish one, her death. No, the only way out of this was to buy herself time. <em>Absorb what information you can, use that information to come to your own conclusion…and exchange that information with those that can help you</em>.</p>
<p>The soldier would be no help here, but the charlatan would.</p>
<p>Harrow look’s to the group, her expression softening into a less menacing, uninterested gaze, not only surveying them, but attempting to connect eyes with whomever be the first to look her way.</p>

<p>Watching the Woman's face frozen for moments on end, Z took notice of this pointed-eared creature. He took great care noting every way those eyes darted, the faint glimpse of a survivalist instinct behind her gaze before giving way to a softer expression of neutrality and finally locking eyes with her.</p>
<p>Stepping closer he gave a soft smile, the heavy bags under his eyes accentuated in the bright lights as he sipped from his blue coffee cup. Clasping it with both hands he nodded as he stood before her before speaking.</p>
<p>&quot;I see I'm not the only one to be a bit confused upon all of this unveiling. You're quite the sight even amongst the other here.&quot;</p>
<p>Z sips from his cup again when suddenly a purple tentacle snakes forward in front of Harrow as if offering a handshake &quot;I'm Shul'N'Zuroth but you can call me Z&quot;</p>

<p>Not wishing to come across rude -though jumping back initially at the strange apendage- Harrow relaxes reading the mellow expression clinging to the bags under Z's eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Confused...confused its putting it lightly, but yes, its all very dishorienting, <em>heavy</em> even.&quot; She sighs, almost appearing relieved at the man's confession of emotions similar to her's.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh?&quot; Green eyes look down toward the floor momentarily then back up at his, &quot;as are you - a sight that is...uniquely...&quot; she peers over his shoulder at the tenticles enveloping his frame, &quot;-Humanoid.&quot;</p>
<p>Finally, she grips onto the tenticle extended in greeting, lightly at first, weighing the texture, then solidly. A 'man' with a steaming cup, a gentle voice and sincere demenor made her feel momentarily comforted, enough that she felt comfortable touching his unknown biological texture.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello shool-nuh...shuhl en zoo-&quot; a blackened left hand slapped her forhead &quot;-Z. I really wanted to try and say your full name, but I'll save myself the potential offense to you from now on. Harrow - my name that is, you can call me, well...Harrow.&quot; She smiled at him sheepishly.</p>
<p>&quot;How are you handling, well, <em>all of this</em>?&quot; He seemed so wholehearted, tranquil even, yet was it not often the case that even the most quiet individuals struggled through fear and unease just as everyone did, they were just good ad hiding it?</p>

<p>Z gives a laugh covering his mouth a bit with his hand before answering the woman before him.</p>
<p>&quot; I appreciate the effort and applaud you for trying. It's a name originally not meant to be pronounced by humans, if you'd believe it.&quot;</p>
<p>Z takes another sip from his coffee before continuing</p>
<p>&quot; All things considered well...I've been much better. I'm sure like you my thoughts have been reeling with 'what ifs' and 'what coulds'. My wife and children are probably wondering where I'm at and the congregation at this point has certainly been confused as to where the high priest is at...all this to say I am fine hehe. Care for a cup of coffee?&quot;</p>
<p>Zs tentacles suddenly emerge from his back holding an electric kettle made of what looks like bone, a box of assorted coffee and teas, and another blue mug being polished with a rag by another tentacle</p>

<p>High priest? People depending on him? Wife?! <em>Child</em>?! Her expression shifts into a somber note, eyes downcast, briefly lost in an instance of reflection. She shakes her head in frustraition at whatever thoughts are racing behind her eyes. Eventually, Harrow looks to him, directly in his eyes, holding his gaze ardently when he utters <em>'I am fine</em>'. Potentially it could just be a cover up, but realistically, she assumed, he had alot more weighing him down than he let on. Whatever the case may be, she had no reason to burden him with anymore discomfort. When she spoke, her tone was sincere and genial.</p>
<p>&quot;I would like one actually...thank you Z.&quot; She nod's and cups her hands together, carefully wrapping her fingers around the mug.</p>
<p>Waiting for him to gift her with the beverage, she add's &quot;You must really be worried for them - your family I mean, not knowing where or <em>when</em> youv'e gone. Would you tell me their name's? You...don't have to if you do not feel comfortable doing so.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Please don't worry over me. I am not lacking in worry but there is to much at stake for all of us here.&quot; Z gives another soft smile as his tentacle begins to pour the hot boiling water while another adds the instant coffee in mixing it about as Z continues</p>
<p>&quot;Greg is the oldest at 10 years old. He's a big fan of a game we call 'Catch the Jabberwocky'. Quite a literal name not creative at all&quot; he snickers before going on. &quot;Then there's my daughter Stacy. She just turned 7 last month and loves animals. We got her a pet Cthylla though it was still not potty trained heh. And finally Horus, our happiest accident. He tries to be an athlete like his older brother but his tentacles grew in a lot sooner and he doesn't quite have the knack for controlling them yet so he's quite clumsy&quot;</p>
<p>Z lifts his cup to his lips only to find he's run out of coffee. The tentacle with the kettle goes to pour it only to find that not only is it empty, but seems to run out of battery. Reaching into his sleeve Z pulls out a small vial with a viscous darkl red liquid. Holding the kettle up, he slowly pours the liquid into the runes on the kettle, which have gone dark until now. As the liquid runs through the grooves and indentations on the bone, the kettle itself almost seems to soak it up till the runes are all glowing again. Content, Z fills the kettle back up and the water starts to slowly heat</p>
<p>&quot;What of yourself, Harrow? Do you have loved ones you miss as well?&quot;</p>

<p>The first drink of coffee, delicately sipped with gentle lips, causes Harrow to <em>”mmmm”</em> as she listens to Z continue. The nervous grasp around the mug she previously had fades, her fingers now slipping around its frame more comfortably, in a way one would hold a cup to find comfort from its warmth against cold hands.</p>
<p>Harrow drinks, making sure to savor each taste, and listens to Z talk about his family. There is a phantom smile on her lips that seem to contrast with a glint of ache in her gaze. Quiet chuckles emit from her at Z recalling the details of his children's hobbies and personalities. Her head nod’s sincerely, invested in Z’s memories.</p>
<p>When he finishes speaking, Harrow’s attention turns to the kettle. Her brow raises curiously when he pulls the vial from the mysteriousness of his sleeve. Lips open, almost starting to ask something, but she stops herself, deciding just to watch, to study, before inquiring. It was a fascinating contraption, the kettle appearing to run not on batteries or electrical sources, but some strange alchemical crimson substance. But, her concentration on this event is broken from what he asks her next.</p>
<p>Her fingers grip the mug tighter, there is a moment of silence between them due to Harrow’s thoughts consuming her present. Eventually, with a sigh, a grin returns to her lips and she nods, “Yes…yes I have, well, <em>many</em> loved ones back home. Or…I suppose my pool of actual <em>close</em> companions are quite small, nothing like your beautiful family unfortunately…” Another long pause follow’s. “But there are a few I deeply care about which -like you- I know are wondering where I am…that need my help.” Bringing the mug to her mouth, she takes another lengthy, studious sip.</p>
<p>“Honestly? This ship, this place, picked the <em>deadliest</em> time to bring me here. I’m sure, with you having people relying on you in a similar way, you understand what I mean when I say that…”</p>

<p>&quot;I have some inkling of what you mean, but I'm afraid I myself have never killed...well another human at least. There are many creations of the gods back home that abandon their teachings for a more barbaric life. It doesn't happen often but when it does the stronger of us priests are expected to handle it.

<p>Her eyes flicker downwards, a thought forcing them away from his, then to the side, unable to meet Z's yet. Her body sigh's, head nodding. &quot;Well, I meant more...like...&quot; she pauses. Green-blue glowing pools distant in some difficult memory. &quot;A lot...is at stake in my Earth right now, so much so that this whole 'death game deciding the fate of your home' is the <em>least</em> of my concerns. If I don't get back soon...it might not even matter if...&quot; whatever she was about to say, she shakes it off, finally looking to Z.</p>
<p>&quot;Well-&quot; Harrow clears her throat, &quot;-regardless, I assume my position isn't unique. I have a rebellion to get back to...you have a family. Same kettle, different cups!&quot; Harrow jeer's using a metaphor akin to Z's personal motives. &quot;Speaking of which, that pot of yours is quite curious. Would you mind telling me how it functions? The...vial, the ruins, I assume what I drank really was just coffee and not some mysterious blood ritual juice?&quot; The sentence finishes with a laugh but there is an inquisitive sparkle in her eyes.</p>

<p>Z gives a chuckle &quot;Not exactly no. Well all of our technology was given to us in its base form by the old gods&quot; Z reaches for his tentacle which hands him the kettle turning it to the side showing the runes on it</p>
<p>&quot;These pieces are made of bone, though I assure you they're cleaned and sanitized before any Bone Singers mold it to this shape. Once that's done a rune smith carves in the necessary symbols for the task. In this case just producing heat. After that is as simple as adding a few ounces of blood and it's running for weeks if not months depending on what it is. Bigger things of course require greater sacrifices. If you ever visit you'll notice our trains have a car dedicated to goats&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wow.&quot; She dares to reach out and touch the kettle in wonder, but retracts her hand before making contact. &quot;It's...I've never seen anything like this up close, magic -enchanted type items I mean. Or, I assume that's what this is. My world used to have magic, things much like this kettle -though I don't think they all relied on blood magic. Unfortunately magic like this was quite hard to master, and it was used dangerously. We just have technology now. But there is a beauty to how your kettle works, even in it's creation, formed with so much care. It's beautiful Z, just as I imagine your earth is - probably more so than mine.&quot; She chuckles in a somber tone.</p>
<p>&quot;If more than one of us can somehow find a way to survive what we will be forced to do inevitably, I hope I <em>can</em> come visit your home Z. I have a friend who was obsessed with artifacts like this-&quot; Harrow laughs in a genuine and warm inflection, her fingers curling the right side of her hair behind a pointed ear, &quot;-She was fascinated with old magic. Juniper even said that if magic was ever allowed to be studied again, she'd dedicate her life to wizardry like a crazy old quest giver character in a video game...&quot; the joy on her face doesn't seem to last long after speaking the woman's name.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you scared about the coming days Z? Scared...that you'll never get to see your wife again or your children's faces?&quot; She doesn't let him answer directly, stumbling into her next sentence almost immediately.</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry, that was a bit -mm- heavy of me. I shouldn’t assume that you wouldn’t…that you won’t-&quot; Harrow shakes her head and finally down's the rest of the coffee, staring down at the empty cup once filled with warmth.</p>

<p>Z's expression never changes as the words leave Harrows mouth, simply sipping his coffee before giving a content sigh.</p>
<p>&quot;When I first arrived here I was terrified.  I still am really but I know that's a real possibility, and statistically one that will happen. If possible I would work to ensure these people do not get to carry out their disgusting perversion of a game. But I cannot dwell on it. Another aspect of my job and my life's work back home was dreaming and walking what we call the Dreamlands. Imagine when you sleep not resting, but going to another dimension within your own. Nothing makes sense, up is down, forests are full of lights, a giant beast is guarding doors you must open to escape, and time is diluted so badly it may feel mile Millenia before you can wake up. That's my life every night. It's dangerous work and there's always a chance I may not wake up, or come back unhinged, a changed madman. Heh perhaps some of my sanity did remain there...but I can't dwell on what COULD happen. Only what I can do now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hm,&quot; She hands him back his mug, Z's words making Harrow smile, &quot;you remind me so much of her. Level headed, despite the circumstance, the same '<em>can't worry about shit that ain't yours to give a shit about</em>' attitude, of course, you put it much more eloquently than Juniper does,&quot; She laughs.</p>
<p>A short moment of silence lingers between them, Harrow clearly lost in her own mind after listening to Z.</p>
<p>&quot;Z, I don't like the idea of having to end someone's <em>entire planet</em> just to get back to my own. The cost doesn't seem right. I've killed before, I know how. There was a time it was as easy as breathing for me. But I <em>hate</em>who I was then, and I know, even if i survive, I'll spend the rest of my existence regretting everything I had to do <em>here</em> just to get back there, till the day it consumes me.&quot;</p>
<p>Harrow holds a wishful gaze with Z's gentle eyes seemingly exuding ease and calm.</p>
<p>&quot;If you have any idea how to stop the people in charge from allowing the events of this twisted game to happen, I want in. Let me be clear, if I have to fight, I will...I'm planning on it. But, if there is another way -any way- no matter what I am in the process of doing, I know I want to be a part of the solution to end this for all of us. I am not asking you to trust me, but...I am insinuating that if you come across a path that ensures I get back to Eternity City in time to save my people from massacre, and you <em>also</em> get to hold your Greg, Stacy, and Horus again, I will do everything in my power to help.&quot;</p>

<p>At some point during his exploration, Grug makes eye contact with Harrow. He initially glances away, but soon walks over to her, and looks up at her. &quot;You are... a very tall woman.

<p>He was...an odd creature, and that is truly saying the least considering his earlier <em>ooga booga</em> type run around the room. Humanoid to be sure, but his intelligence seemed to be severely lacking despite his grown phisique. She blinks at him, twice, looking around to make sure he was adressing her but of course he was. His questions were clearly in reguards to her features.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh...uh, hello there sir-little, uh, big man?&quot; Her lips purse, holding back a chuckle at the humorus exchange.</p>
<p>&quot;Do- does <em>Grug</em>, not have tall...women...on his- its- their-&quot; his questions didn't stop in her attempt to answer the first remark. So Harrow lets him continue until he seem's content with his word's.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you saying my ears are strange? Or...these, the <em>shiny</em> things?&quot; Harrow wiggles the tip of her pointy punctured ears, while pointing at the gold labret piercing hugging her bottom lip.</p>

<p>Her lips purse together, listening to him speak. She tuggs on her left ear after he calls them strange, eyes moving about the room now conscience if anyone had similar features like this. &quot;Are they really so odd?&quot; She mutters as he continues. Harrow's left brow raises curiously at his implications of his world. She asks, &quot;Grug...will you understand if I ask you not where but <em>when</em> exactly you came from? <em>Maybe that questions too broad</em>&quot; she finishes with a mumble before adding the correction, &quot;What is your Earth like Grug?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why would not Grug? It is the only world Grug knows! Just because the Gods are wrathful does not make the world bad! Why would Grug <em>not</em> like his world just because it is hard to live in?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;.........Huh....&quot; Is all Harrow utters for an extended period of second's. She looks to the left, then up, then to the right, thoughts appearing to move before her eyes, scrambling to keep up with them all.</p>
<p>&quot;You make a good point Grug. Even my Earth isn't the easiest to live in. However, I still <em>enjoy</em> living in my world -even though every day is hard, yes I'll grant you that truth. But is there anything Grug looks forward to doing every day when he wake's up? Do you feel like your world is perfect or is that just what you have been <em>told</em>? Seem's to me like Grug the Genius could help his world improve alot based on the passion he has for it. Would you change anything about it if you could, Grug?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Grug's world <em>could</em> be perfect if not for the Gods wrath, wrath they will surely cease once Grug emerges victorious! And once Grug returns, he will help his world more, he has learned so much from just this short time in the Heavens! As for what Grug enjoys, though he finds his honorable duty tiring, he always enjoys the sight of his children and teaching them new things!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Grug, I hope that you can get back to your world to teach them all that you have learned, and to see your Earth restored so that the Heaven you see here can someday become a reality there, for all your people.&quot;</p>
<p>She nudges him very softly but ultimately playfully, &quot;If we both make it out of this, I wouldn't mind coming over to your world to help you overthrow the lot of them, the God's I mean...not your kids, if that wasn't clear.&quot; Harrow Jeers.</p>

<p>The mysterious stranger that strides through the room with a kind smile. Their eyes were hazed over with what you could only glean was profound indifference. As you peer into them you feel instinctively that whatever they beheld was incredibly far away. If not in a thousand metrics of distance, then time. Discerning any meaning from them was like trying to project emotion onto a void. Before Harrow can realize, the void is staring back at her, the kind smile on his face still present. They offer you only a simple utterance while passing by.</p>
<p>“Beautiful eyes.”</p>

<p>She blinks at him, then eyes the figure up and down very slowly. Finally, she locks sight with the tower atop his head. Squinting, she gazes at the hat for a long moment, eyes following the text etched along its fibers. There is a moment of relaxation to her posture, only slightly. A blackened left hand comes up to cover her mouth for a moment, seconds before her lips purse together. Harrow breathes in, then looks into the man's eyes still the same odd unsettling expression they were before.</p>
<p>&quot;Beautiful hat. Is...it true what it says?&quot;</p>

<p>“The key?” The stranger inquires yet they already knew having stopped in their tracks. “I suppose so. Regretfully. A self-fulling prophecy unto itself. It is both a symbol of my freedom and its curse. Denied my own hubris and damned to walk this path alone. But solitude has little meaning for the evanescent. And even my long drawn out tale shall pass soon enough too.”</p>
<p>“So no.” The stranger answered flatly with finality. “<em>Truths are just an unattainable ideal cast from the shadows of life’s lies.</em>” The weary man muttered in deafened tones.</p>

<p>Harrow blinks, hard, multiple times. &quot;Do...you always speak in poetic limerick's or is this a special occasion brought on by the melancholy of the state we have all been forced into?&quot; Harrow brings a hand up to her lip's concealing a chuckle. &quot;I more so meant the line about your world being -&quot; she looks at the hat again, &quot;-'alone on this <em>barren earth</em>'. Seems a little sad that a man with such an artistic tongue should live on an Earth that is barren.&quot; She gives him a pitied smile</p>

<p>Noticing the violent feelings Harrow was working on subduing Destiny Dude approaches her. &quot;If you're planning on attacking our 'Host' you should do it sooner rather than later.&quot;</p>

<p>He had the physique of a warrior. His deep brown skin etched with scars spoke to Harrow in well-known patterns, each one a tale of the hardships and battles he survived. The curls atop his head were structured in such a way that was both majestically beautiful, but also carefree, in a  dutiful sense. Much like Harrow’s own loosely tied back ponytail she hadn't undone in weeks, there were too many tasks or missions to complete to bother with that kind of trifle. He had no time to give toward vain appearances. Even his clothes seemed to mimic this. Simplistic, rugged, but practical, and similar to his flesh, stained with marks of earth and all the places he had traveled. Yet, there was a beauty to it, a spirit inside of the man that, just at first glance, she admired.</p>
<p>It made sense that he would be the one to notice her moment of fierce determination. And for this she respected him even more, albeit still weary of all the new faces in general.</p>
<p>She looked into his eyes, then to the floor, almost slightly ashamed of her lapse in judgment. She wasn’t exactly sure yet if he was being serious about his sentiment, or if he was saying it in an attempt to remind her of what she already knew. That being, acting on her violent urges would not give her the outcome he wanted. The man wearing the crown wouldn’t invite them into his presence if he felt threatened by any of them, her included. Unless…he was indeed serious. It was hard for her to determine…but she was curious if he <em>was</em> insinuating something.</p>
<p>Harrow’s right hand meets with her left and encircles her blackened wrist thoughtfully.</p>
<p>“Hm…it’s probably not the best play to make in this situation, at least not here in front of all these witnesses that is,” she looks at his face and gives him a glimpse of a playful grin that doesn’t quite meet her eyes, desperately trying to study the expression that comes next in his.</p>

<p><em>Beep! Beep! Beep! Beep!</em> A rhythmic chirp echoes throughout the ballroom. <em>Beep! Beep!</em> They sound off almost in tandem to the hefty clunks of the stranger’s spotless boots, trekking a path through the center of the room. A crude palm pilot the size of a brick was held before them with a gloved hand. The antiquated device appeared to be the source of the repeating chirp. Letting out a sharp note each time the stranger passes another. <em>Beep! Beep! Beep!</em></p>
<p>How many was the count? A dozen? Maybe several more. The stranger’s gaze remained fixed upon the device. Silent. A mechanical switch was pressed and all signs of life displayed on the dot matrix screen dissipated. He pockets the device, and directs his gaze upward. They see before them the sea of stars.</p>

<p>Noticing him staring at the stars, Henry sidles up to Hovantis, shattering the brief peace of the moment.</p>
<p>“Pretty cool right?” It’s not so much a question but an affirmation. Henry smiles and wags his eyebrows in a way that looks stupid on his face.</p>
<p>He takes a moment to read the text on the hat Hovantis wears. If he has an opinion on the garment, he does not show it before silently joining Hoovantis in his stargazing</p>
<p>“Believe it or not this isn’t the first time I’ve been in space.” Henry pauses, perhaps waiting for a gasp of shock or something. “A few years I paid a fortune to get into a rocket and be slingshot to the final frontier”.</p>
<p>“I guess it wasn’t so final after all.” He adds after a moments thought. “I dunno. I was bored. I didn’t even get to see anything, I passed out.”</p>
<p>He smiles, looking back at Hoovantis.</p>
<p>“Goes to show you.” By the smug tone in his voice, it’s clear that Henry believes he's just imparted some great wisdom.</p>

										</div>										<div class='conversation-post-body'>
<p>The stranger nods as if in agreement. “Very little in these worlds is final. There is always something beyond what we can grasp.” He turned and offered a kind smile. “This is not my first voyage either, though our expansion into the stars was a short-lived one. Several generations decimated in the blink of an eye. When I first arrived on the lunar colony, it felt more as if I had stepped into a tomb littered with the remains of ages long past than the next step in evolution.”</p>
<p>“Humanity is an incredibly feeble thing. Like fish plucked out of the water, our ability to adapt outside our own habitat is woefully limited. Knowing we could never truly reach the stars, we strived towards alternative means. Yet, it would seem our hosts have managed to achieve faster than light travel despite its many hurdles, and without destroying themselves in the process. Or so it seems. It's rather regretful. I wonder how my colleagues would feel if they were in my place now.”</p>

<p>Grug's eye twitches every time the beeping noise goes off. Whenever Hovantis comes close to Grug and his device goes off, Grug, who was looking in another direction, whirls around. &quot;What is that unpleasant noise which you bring near Grug!?&quot; He growls. &quot;Grug implores you to have it cease!&quot; As he says this he stomps one foot on the ground and covers his ears.</p>

<p>“The milky way…” The stranger uttered. “A small glimpse of home. To be perfectly frank, I never thought I’d lay eyes upon it again.” Having had a moment to take the spectacle in, the stranger turns to Grug, his oddly tall fishing cap towering over the caveman like a monolith as he makes his approach. “Uncover your ears.” he waves his hand passively “That should be the last of them, <em>lest we receive any unexpected guests.</em>” They assured Grug the chirping had ceased for now. A kind smile forms on the stranger’s face as he looks at Grug longer. “One could easily mistake themselves for being amongst the heavens here, yet the contrast between ourselves would more strongly suggest this a crossroads between times.”</p>
<p>“Fascinating, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>&quot;You have Grug's appreciation for stopping,&quot; he grumbles, his arms falling to his sides. &quot;Milky... way? The dwelling of the Gods? It is clear to Grug that we <em>are</em> chosen, we now stand in God's home!&quot; He looks up at the fishing cap, and squints at it. &quot;It is still incredible to Grug that these etchings can have meaning assigned to them, Grug never conceived of such a thing before, amazing...&quot; he seems to actually read the words. &quot;Why do women fear you? Grug does not look away from you.&quot; He stares directly into Hovantis' eyes.</p>

<p>“Ah, then you’ve been blessed with the ability to read upon coming here. That’s wonderful. The written word can be incredibly powerful. You would do well to cherish it. ” The stranger nods at Grug approvingly, then pinches the bill of his cap once the caveman makes inquiries, adjusting it slightly as a light chuckle escapes him. “A crude joke I suppose.” he turned to his faint reflection upon the window beside them, and smirked at himself. “I must admit it is a rather odd slogan, if not painfully ironic.” he turns back to the caveman with a straight face “This hat is actually not my own, but a relic from another world if you would believe it. Possibly one of the strangest I’ve been to.” The stranger looks around and nods. “Upon entering that world my immediate surroundings resembled an idyllic lakeside cabin retreat. Abundant in furnishings and supplies for all of one’s every need. The walls were lined with photographs of myself with a family I did not recognize, but clearly were very loved in their depictions. In many ways, it could be described as the spitting image of paradise for some. Only, that homely unassuming cabin <em>was all that world consisted of.</em> The lake and its surrounding forest may as well have been a cutout backdrop pasted to the windows, rendered forever unreachable from that cabin-shaped prison. Perhaps never truly there to begin with. There was no way in, or out. For seven decades I was trapped there.” The stranger’s tone dampened as they went on, sounding rather tired. Unexpectedly their tune takes a turn for the jovial “Thankfully the television was fully operable.” They smile, leaving their story of the mysterious cabin world unfinished.</p>

<p>The man adjusted the cap, seemingly reluctant to remove it “I suppose I’ve held onto it all this time as a token of good luck. As absurd as it might sound I think it rather suits me too. After all, I’ve walked this barren earth alone for quite some time now.”</p>
<p>“You’re a lively one, stranger. That’s good. A strong spirit is mandatory for venturing beyond.”</p>
<p>The comically tall fishing cap tilts as the man’s attention is drawn elsewhere, to the upper balcony where their host resides. “Very few worlds define their keys upon entering. Fortune smiles on us.”</p>

<p>&quot;Grug has no idea of what several of those words mean, but is grateful that you told him the story anyways. It was a good story. It is good to have a good luck charm, though Grug is not lucky... but Grug does not require luck!&quot;</p>

<p>“I’ve far too many stories to share than the time allotted to us, it appears, but you are welcome. I would advise you to page through a dictionary or two in your stay here. Mastery of the languages has never been more paramount for your survival, I'm afraid.” The stranger gives Grug an encouraging clap on the shoulder. “You’re standing before me now. A place countless others have fallen to their inevitable demise before ever reaching. For that, you are plenty lucky.”</p>

<p>&quot;What... is a dictionary? Or... a page? Grug had never seen symbols to derive meaning from before, but it seems he was granted such an ability by these merciful Gods for this game specifically.&quot;</p>
<p>Grug nods as Hovantis claps him on the shoulder. &quot;Perhaps, perhaps Grug is.&quot;</p>

<p>“The symbols are letters. We put them together to form words. A dictionary is a collection of these words, and defines their meaning clearly. The more words one knows, the more ability they have to communicate in the written form.”</p>
<p>Hovantis pulls out a book titled <em>The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress</em>
<em>A novel by Robert A. Heinlein</em></p>
<p>He begins to page through the book as an example while continuing his lesson.</p>
<p>“Paper or parchment is a man created object, typically made from woodpulp, but sometimes hemp or other natural materials. When you stack those pages together we call that a book or tomb. Before the invention of paper, the first civilizations that formed the written word used stone slabs to carve their letters upon. Some of the earliest examples were usually a list of commands, or a code that the tribes would adhere to if they wished to be a part of that civilization. Later these tales would become accounts of our experiences, and eventually even complete fiction, tales made entirely from one’s own imagination. The advancement of humanity as we know it owes it all to the written word, the sharing of ideas between generations. It is the passing of a torch which brought us out of the stone age.”</p>
<p>The stranger took a pause so as to not lose the caveman.</p>
<p>“Grug was it? A strong name. Mine is Hovanits.”</p>
<p>“Here.” Hovantis reaches into his coat pocket and retrieves the bulky palm pilot that was chirping up a storm prior. “Eventually, even paper became old hat, and we began storing the written word in digital devices such as this. I’ll allow you to borrow this for the remainder of the day should it serve you well. Simply press this button here and ask it to define whatever word the others here use that mystify you. You may learn something new. Perhaps even something that will save your life.”</p>

<p>&quot;Hoe-vant-tiss.&quot; Grug carefully pronounces. &quot;Hovantis is outstanding! Amazing! I understand, what a new and brilliant idea! A written language! Incredible! Maybe Grug's ancestors had such a thing before they were struck down! Perhaps that is the cause of the faded colors on the walls, strange patterns, yes! Yes!&quot; He foregoes taking the palm pilot and immediately grabs Hovantis in a mighty hug. &quot;Even Grug would have a difficult time constructing such an idea on his own!&quot;</p>

<p>The engineer sooner expected indifference to his offer than the forceful praise given. Nevertheless, the mustached fellow accepts the embrace in stride as a moment of surprise passes. A hearty chuckle escapes them.</p>
<p>“High praise accepted, but I could hardly take credit for the written word myself.” The stranger nods at the caveman affirmatively and squeezed them back. “Yes, should you be allowed to return to your Earth, this knowledge alone shall likely change everything. Make no mistake, introducing monumental change is no simple task, but a well worthwhile one should you persevere . You have a friend that believes in you. Godspeed.”</p>

<p>Following the sound of the strange and annoying noise emanating from Hovantis's direction, Ami eventually catches up with him and peeks at the device from over his shoulder. &quot;What a strange piece of technology! It reminds me of a metal detector back home, yet I doubt you'd be looking for metal in a place like this.&quot;</p>

<p>As Ami peeks over the stranger’s shoulder, for a brief second she can see a tallying of data displayed via digital text.</p>
<p><code>-  9,737,011 Worlds Logged</code>
<code>- 5 Missing Persons Found</code>
<code>- 121 Entities Encountered</code>
<code>- 1,192,413,938,839,674-</code></p>
<p>The dot matrix screen immediately turned blank upon the pressing of a mechanical button, flushing away whatever data was displayed on it moments prior. “Hm?” the stranger turns to the curious mushroom and nods after considering their query “Something like that you could say, yes. I developed this device to serve as a log for my travels. However, instead of detecting metals embedded in the Earth, it logs entities in the surrounding area such as yourself.”</p>

<p>&quot;Ahh, I see...&quot; Ami ponders. Hovantis's explanation flies over her head a bit, but she thinks she gets the gist of it. &quot;Then you must have met many entities in your travels, then, in order to need such a detailed log?&quot;</p>

<p>“No.” The stranger replies flatly. “Scarcely any worlds harbor inhabitants at all. Many of my colleagues are still unaccounted for. Worse more, very few still resembled any vestige of their humanity upon finding them.“</p>
<p>“None of which possessed the will to continue on any longer.” The man’s tone grew intense with grave somber.</p>

<p>“Scientists and engineers.” The stranger smiled kindly. “There is no need to apologize. We all participated in the construction of the star rail fully knowing how severe the risks were.”</p>
<p>The stranger observes Ami sharply “It seems your world too has undergone a dramatic shift. Your form could be considered troubling knowing the inherent danger of entities, but your humanity appears fully intact. It creates a rather disarming cadence, but one charming nonetheless.”</p>
<p>The stranger offered out a gloved hand in gesture for a shake. “Hovantis. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking to?”</p>

<p>“A potentially lethal prognosis then. Yes, that is a cause for concern. Yet, perhaps a fate not inescapable on these crossroads where anything appears possible in the pursuit of perfection.” He gave condolences.</p>
<p>“Hovantis.” The man smiles kindly as he repeats himself, giving the woman no grief for missing it the first time. “You might find me a rather forgettable man. Especially in such exotic company. I’m afraid the many years of solitude in my travels has left me somewhat amiss in this social gathering of Earth hailing champions.”</p>

<p>As you explore the wide, opulent halls of the ship, one of the many oddities seems to stand out a little more than the rest. Near the front of the ship, a part of the hallway wall has a cubic recess cut out of it about two feet wide. The walls of the recess are painted a bright red, with bright lights shining in it from the top. Tacky, plasticky, faux gold adorns the area, with a red, circular, paper lantern hanging from the ceiling. In the middle of it is a white, plastic cat about 10 inches tall that appears to be sitting on top of a red pillow. The cat waves, or beckons rather, with its left paw rhythmically, a painted-on smile on its face.</p>
<p>As you approach the display, a squeaky voice comes from the cat, though it doesn’t seem to have a functioning mouth. In fact, none of the cat appears to be moving, save for its waving paw.</p>
<p>“Hi, meow!! You’re one of the people for the game, right? Hope you’re enjoying Prosit, meow! Come on, get over here, I’m good luck, meow!!” The cat doesn’t appear to be looking directly at you, likely because it cannot move its head.</p>

<p><em>Luck?</em> She questions, finding herself drawn to the mysterious jovial talking animatronic in the red room. She has seen creations like these before. Moving cyber creations with personality based AI’s that can speak and respond to most mundane questions. However, the fact that this one seemed to call to her directly as she passed, and knew her status on the ship, intrigued Harrow. Of course, it could be that the cat was directly installed with a database of the entire ship and its people, but it was unusual the way it beckoned her to it, offering such a seemingly innocent notion. Usually they wanted money.</p>
<p>She had relied on luck quite a few times in her years, but it wasn't full-proof. Obviously she trusted her own abilities more than mere luck, but she would do anything she could to get back home. It seemed to her that a bit of luck would only help.</p>
<p>“Curious little thing…” She speaks softly, a finger on her right hand gently rubbing the cat atop its head as if to pet it. “Tell me, tiny computer cat. Why should any of us enjoy what's happening to us? Do you enjoy your existence being reduced to an ornament in a small room?” She wanted to know how much the cat knew, what it was programmed to say, and how far it could respond to questions without going back into repeated phrases - that is if it were just a mere computer chip.</p>

<p>Approaching the cut out in the wall, Barbatos crouches down so he can look at the plastic cat. A mixture of both concern and confusion spreads across his face.</p>

<p>&quot;What...are...you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I could ask you that, too! And I will, meow!! Most Earths don't have such animally people, meow! What your name, meow?! How's your Earth, meow?!&quot;</p>
<p>The figure continues speaking without a pause. &quot;As for me, I'm a lucky cat, meow! I give people good luck!! Or I'm a maneki-neko, or a waving cat, or a beckoning cat, or a zhao cai mao, meow! But my name is Miao-Mao, meow!! Isn't that funny, meow?!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A...lucky cat...?</p>
<p>Barbatos holds his chin and ponders for a moment, and then rests his arms on his legs. &quot;My name is Barbatos Dragonhoff. My Earth is...&quot;</p>
<p>Barbatos pauses again, and then nods. &quot;I don't know about many Earths...but mine certainly has many different people. I am a tiger man. We are rare, but certainly heard of by many. How...is my Earth? Well, when you aren't freezing in sub-zero temperatures or being roasted by the blazing sun, it is nice. The barriers certainly help.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A tiger man, huh?! Then you're kinda like me, meow!! You're... kinda like a cat... but not really, I guess. Meow.&quot; There's an awkward pause as the loud demeanor of its voice turns quiet for a moment.</p>
<p>&quot;B-but who cares about that, meow!!! Like I said, I'm lucky, meow!! Hey, you know what's even luckier than being around me, which is already super lucky, meow?!!&quot; It sounds like it's attempting to change the topic. &quot;Hey, lean in close and I'll tell you something you're gonna wanna know, meow!! And we can forget all about being a cat or whatever!! Or, I-I dunno, I don't know why I even mentioned that, meow!! Don't-I mean, just forget about it, let's talk about my room!!

<p>“No traveler can pass up good fortune. Obliged.” A hefty thunk is made as the stranger drops their backpack to the floor and perches themselves upon it as an impromptu seat. “Tell me Neko-san,” he leans into a comfortable slouched position, resting both elbows on his knees. “Has Prosit been your home for long? Entities like you appear to be uncommon here. A stark contrast from what I’ve grown used to.” The stranger offers a kind smile. They appear unperturbed by your unusual existence.</p>

<p>&quot;But I don't really know how long I've been here! Like a... a lot of years, maybe, meow!! I don't see a lot of lucky cats here either, but its fun meeting new people so that's okay, meow!!

<p>“That’s why it pays to keep a count of things.” The stranger pulls a large archaic palm pilot out of his coat pocket for a moment in gesturing before returning it. “That certainly must have been a long time, after a certain point it can start to lose its meaning.” The stranger spoke as if from experience.</p>
<p>“My Earth. It has… been quite some time since it resembled something familiar to reality. Despite keeping a detailed log of my travels, the life I led before venturing beyond feels like a hazy dream half forgotten. Forgive me, Miao-san.” The man rubbed his chin in recollection, wondering what tales would satiate the plastic feline. “Hmm.” he stares deeply at Miao “I suppose seeing you reminds me of cold nights in Hokkaido. The facility there was located in a rather remote area with few options in amenities. After many late evenings of research concluded, my colleagues and I would gather at the same place for udon to warm our bones. It is a nostalgic feeling.” he nods “Hm. Your visage was plentiful in Tokyo as well.”</p>

<p>“Our Earth. From what I understand it was not radically different from the others. At least at first. Our civilization has been industrialized for nearly six hundred years now. Back when Tokyo was still Edo, the birthplace of modern civilization. Now, in current times when one looks down upon the Earth from the stars, there is more grey than blue or green. Large swaths of the planet are paved over in concrete. From above the cities resemble more a series of giant sarcophaguses lined in orderly rows with their pragmatically brutalist architecture. As the climate continually worsened from modern society’s expanse, the Earth itself started to wane under the immense pressure. It was no longer enough. We sought sovereignty amongst the stars, but the losses were many, and any meaningful gains few. It became self-evident that interstellar travel was beyond our means, and colonizing our local system pointless, but the powers that be would not accept that answer of inevitable fate. Thus the V.I.S.T foundation was formed. Voyaging Interdimensional Space Technologies. I was assigned as the lead engineer behind the development of the star rail.”</p>
<p>“The end result could only betray one's expectations for such a romantic vision the name would suggest. In the aim of sparing you a story far too long to tell, I shall say, we were successful in our mission. However, in completing that mission, the Earth and universe as we knew it was forever lost. Unrecognizable.”</p>
<p>The stranger stared deeply at the neko, perhaps finished with his tale.</p>
<p>“Most of the colleagues I found after venturing beyond the star rail no longer resembled a human form, even more so the entities capable of sentience whose existence were unexplainable. So I find it difficult to be taken aback by your appearance, regardless of origin.” The stranger chuckled softly. “No. It would be the rest of our company that seems alien to me now. The others here are far more human than I’m used to since venturing beyond.”</p>

<p>&quot;Luck can be a double edged sword. Or a candle burnt on both ends.&quot; The man spoke almost involuntarily.</p>
<p>After a pause they acquiesce. &quot;Hai, Maio-san. Tell me your secrets.&quot; the weary traveler plucked up the plastic neko and held them close to their head as if to hear whispers of profound wisdom.</p>

<p>Her body stiffens and she assumes a more formal greeting position. It's obvious this is not the first time she's done this. &quot;Yumi Dae; Chi Association. At your service.&quot;</p>
<p>She scratches her head, &quot;Although, I don't suppose that would mean anything here...&quot;</p>
<p>She takes a brief moment to ponder the implications of the cat's claims. &quot;...So this game is a constant ongoing for the people on the ship?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, sorry!!! I don't know what the Chi Association is, meow!! You're look like you're probably real important though, I bet!! Maybe!!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I guess it is kinda like a constant, meow! Mr. Max has been doing it for way longer than I've been here, and we're gonna have to keep going for... I dunno, meow!! A really long time, meow!! But it's fun, I like meeting all the new people and stuff, meow!! You know the rooms and stuff?!! People always say my room is the best, you know, meow!!

<p>&quot;Yes yes, of course. In some cultures back home, you are a symbol of good luck and prosperity. Though I'd always had thought that was an urban legend. Could it possibly be that you have <em>real</em> power to influence the luck of a person?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Also you've got a whole room for yourself? I would have thought you stayed on this pedestal watching passerbyers! What a strange little kitty you are 🤔 &quot;</p>

<p>A gaping void intrudes on what might otherwise be a balcony. The objects inside let you estimate distances to some extent, but it's still difficult with no visible walls, floor or ceiling to define the inky depths.</p>
<p>Cosmic spiders have left their thin, shimmering webs of spacetime hanging between various geometric solids. Orbs in various colors circle and pull on each other in the microgravity. Space is lying down on a dull green one, which swings close to a larger red one in a tight slingshot maneuver.</p>

<p>&quot;You, there,&quot; she says in Space's general direction, &quot;are you a person? You don't look like anyone I've ever seen before. In fact, this whole room is... wondrous... and a little intimidating.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It did eventually open, but I don't know the exact details,&quot; Ami explains. &quot;But, the Altering just started in the small area it was initially contained in, but the scientists could not stop the spread of it.

<p>Benjamin stands still, eyes closed. He holds a hand to his chest as he takes several long, drawn-out breaths.
<em>In</em>
<em>Out</em>
<em>In</em>
<em>Out</em>
With a concluding sigh, he peers down at his loosely out-stretched hand. His eyes dart about left and right as if reading something over, but nothing is there. His pamphlet, perhaps? Nothing? Who knows.
His other hand slithers its way into his suit, fetching within some sort small rectangular device. A <em>cellphone</em> to some. His fingers race across the screen as his eyes bathe in the phone's white glow.</p>

<p>In a clear invasion of personal space, Grug, who is shorter than Benjamin, approaches from behind. He seems to have made little sound in his approach, and stands on his tip-toes to look over Benjamin's shoulder at the phone. Right next to Benjamin's ear, Grug says, rather loudly: &quot;A glowing rock?!&quot; and suddenly reaches for the cell phone.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;Aaaaahh!&quot;</strong> Benjamin cries out, suddenly jumping in place as the cellphone rockets out of his hands into the air. &quot;Wh-what in the world!?&quot;</p>
<p>He quickly spins around to face Grug, his eyes still wide as he attempts to catch his breath. The cellphone twirls in the air before landing on the floor between them with a <em><strong>THUD</strong></em>. Amazingly, nothing seems to be broken.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh... oh man... sorry... you just... startled me there...&quot;</p>

<p>As Benjamin shouts and jumps up, Grug leaps backwards from the man. &quot;Where, what!?&quot; His head jerks back and forth as he looks around--when he doesn't immediately see anything he quickly looks up and down.</p>
<p>He pauses as Benjamin regains his composure. &quot;Oh. Grug had no intention of alarming you...&quot; he wanders over to the cell phone on the ground, and reaches down to pick it up.</p>

<p>Benjamin loses no time in snatching up the phone from Grug, quickly inspecting it from seemingly every angle. A muffled <em>&quot;Phew&quot;</em> escapes his lips as orients the screen towards himself.</p>
<p>&quot;This here is my cellphone,&quot; he says relatively calmly as he splits his attention between the phone and Grug. &quot;You know, like a normal phone... but mobile. It's basically my everything. Music, videos, games... Other things... I'm not sure what'd I do without it.&quot;</p>

<p>Benjamin pauses for a moment in contemplation before continuing further.</p>
<p>&quot;This. This right here,&quot; he exclaims, pointing at his phone. &quot;I can speak at <em>this</em> right here. And in turn I will hear something back. Or at least normally I could if I was <em>anywhere</em> but here. That is what it means for something to be a phone.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Brick? No no no. Phone.&quot;</p>
<p>Benjamin closes his eyes and inhales slowly, his lips tightening and twisting inward before loosening everything with one big exhale. &quot;Pretend I had two of these. <em>Two</em> phones. I could give you one so that we each had <em>one</em> phone. Yes? You could then go anywhere you want to away from me and talk at your own phone. I would be able to hear everything you say. Your voice would come out of the phone I was holding. Likewise, I could talk into mine and my voice would come out of the one you'd be holding. It would be just like how we are communicating now face to face, except we would not be standing in front of each other.&quot;</p>

<p>The Count takes notice of the smartly dressed man. He looks disapprovingly when Benjamin pulls out his device. “Tch. No wonder your eyes seem to have dried out. You are glued to a screen first thing. Does that gadget even work here?”</p>

<p>&quot;Unfortunately it doesn't seem so,&quot; Benjamin replies calmly, betraying the frustration slowly creeping across his face. &quot;The battery should hold out for quite a while, but nothing is loading. Expected, I suppose.&quot;</p>
<p>He glances briefly over at Archibald, giving him the once over before returning his gaze to the phone. &quot;Not too bad yourself, my fine, uh, friend? Enemy? Sorry, this whole thing is kind of sudden here. <em>Ahem</em>. The clothes are both my standard uniform and all I got.&quot;</p>
<p>His eyes dart back to the man. &quot;How about you? Is that what you wear all the time? Kind of reminds me of a character from a game.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is that a screen slate? I haven't seen one of those in <em>ages</em>! I've always liked the way those look. So classy~&quot;</p>
<p>Yumi puts two fingers to her temple. &quot;Yeah, my communicators been acting up ever since I've arrived. For better or for worse, it looks like mine isn't the only one.&quot;</p>

<p>His face brightens slightly, giving a slight chuckle. &quot;Ha, glad I'm not the only one having issues here. By chance have a Xamxung too? Maybe that's the issue.&quot;</p>

<p>Archie seems perplexed by Benji’s question. “Errr… no. I never heard of a ‘Xpple’ before. That sounds like something my daughter would be interested in however. I do own a phone, but I only use it if I absolutely need to. I’m not particularly fond of screen gadgets and their ilk.”</p>
<p>“And yes, this attire is my standard wear. You’ll scarcely see me without it. I know nothing of whatever game you’re referring to. Again, my child is likely more knowledgeable on that matter. But I’ll take that as a compliment nonetheless.” He chuckles dryly.</p>

<p>&quot;Suppose I'm out of luck for the moment,&quot; Benji responds to Archie, biting his lip. &quot;Tch. This was going to be unarchived too. The least our gracious host here could do is let me have one final stream. Ah well.&quot;</p>
<p>He pockets the cellphone before continuing. &quot;A child, though... That must be exciting. I'm sure others have asked you before, but what line of work are you in? Must be some decent money in it to support a family.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And you Miss Ami,&quot; Benjamin quickly turns to face the short woman, giving a short bow himself. &quot;A pleasure to meet you, even in these unfortunate circumstances. The name's Benjamin. Benjamin Trout.&quot;</p>
<p>His eyes peer downwards while scratching his chin. &quot;I take it you yourself are a plantfolk then? Interesting... Which would make this-&quot; He moves to place a hand on the woman's mushroom cap. &quot;-your head? Most intriguing... Plants only ever dance in the wind where I'm from, though the concept isn't completely foreign to me. Certainly showed up from time to time in media.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I've heard that from some elders back home as well,&quot; Ami replies. &quot;It's funny though, their conceptions of plantfolk were usually pretty horrifying in comparison to what the majority of us are really like. Though I won't lie, some of nature's bounty does not merge very gracefully with the human genome...&quot; she gulps a little before continuing, &quot;but people make do with what they're given.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You look a bit like the butlers shown in classical media where I'm from,&quot; Ami chuckles. &quot;Was that your job before, by chance?&quot;</p>

<p>Benjamin gives a frustrated grunt. &quot;It's a complicated matter really. When I had nothing left, he took me in. Gave me food and a bed. In turn I helped him around the house. Over time, he became unable to accomplish the same tasks he once could, so they in turn became new chores for me.&quot;</p>
<p>He stares down at the ground as he places two fingers above his temple. &quot;Always resisted getting more help. <em>I was the only one he could trust</em> or something like that. It all just became too much. This was years, mind you. Decades of taking care of that whole entire place.&quot;</p>

<p>Ami's voice takes on a quiet, sympathetic tone. &quot;Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you were definitely overworked. Did he have a large estate for you to tend to, then? Seems like he was a well-off man.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh he was tremendously wealthy!&quot; Benjamin fires off. &quot;I probably have photos somewhere on my phone, but the place was massive. Huge garden. Even had a secondary housing unit. Could probably fit several families there, which he basically did with those extravagant parties of his.&quot;</p>
<p>He takes a deep breath, plucking the monocle from his eye. Wiping it with a cloth retrieved from the suit, he carefully sets the monocle back in place before continuing. &quot;Dreadful place. Started to blame me for every little thing that went wrong too, so I guess in the end even I wasn't worthy of his trust.&quot;</p>

<p>A pale girl falters, but regains her composure enough to stay standing. While rubbing her eyes she mutters &quot;So much... so bright,&quot; almost imperceptible in the din of the spaceship.</p>

<p>&quot;Hopefully, I... think I'm getting a grip on this strange place. My name is Mabel Sinclair, it's nice to meet you...?&quot; she trails off.</p>

<p>Mabel snaps back to attention, saying &quot;Ah... sorry, no, I just completely lost track with everything going on lately... I think he'll be ok, but... when you get that sinking feeling in your stomach, you want to know for certain...&quot;</p>
<p>With a sigh, she looks at Ami again. &quot;I am being a dreadful partner to this conversation... Thank you, Ami, for your patience. But as for my daily life... it's not a happy story, not that any story in a dying planet would end well, one swallowed by global warming... folly created of human's own hands, it seems. My family was rich enough for me to... not want for anything more, but most my days are empty for me to while away myself... stray books, snatches of music, empty streets. It's... not much point to keep track.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But... strangely, things seem different here,&quot; she ponders. &quot;I feel so much more... energetic? Outspoken? than I've felt my whole life, like a bubbling spring in my core.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So thank you for your company, Ami&quot; she softly smiles. &quot;I hope you had fonder days in your past?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Things have been relatively peaceful, I suppose,&quot; Ami says warmly. &quot;About thirty years ago, they were tumultuous though. Some scientists found an alien device in a desert and managed to crack it open after a while... and, despite their best efforts, within about five years, the entire Earth became Altered. I was born after the fact, so I have no idea what the world was really like prior to the Altering. We have had to get used to a lot of new changes, heheh.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did you collect a lot of relics from times gone by? You seem like the nostalgic type.&quot;</p>

										</div>										<div class='conversation-post-body'>
<p>&quot;Ah! It seems we're two kindred spirits, Ami. I was born after The Transformation, and... so many others knew what life was like beforehand, but for someone like me whose only known the helplessness after it, it's been... like an alien in my own world's history. Exactly like you. I can only guess what things were like.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's hard to say I'm... nostalgic for a time I never knew, so, rather it's a... feeling of wanting to belong?&quot;</p>
<p>Mabel goes quiet for a bit.</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry, I've never thought of things like this before. Even though all this time I never considered... any of this. And now there's so many feelings and thoughts in my head. Jumbled like a whirlpool.&quot;</p>
<p>Mabel giggles and says &quot;Really, though, I'd like to hear more about you. Aliens? Something like that is... real? Goodness, what did they do to change your planet so much?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Strangely enough, the people on my world never met the entities responsible for the Altering. We know for certain that the device that caused it is alien, the material was not native to our Earth... but once the box was opened, things just started changing. It happened before my time so I can't say for certain what the process was like, but the history books say it was like a pixelated fog seeped into everything around the device and eventually spread. It's honestly beyond my comprehension.&quot;</p>

<p>Mabel winces a bit. &quot;That... must have been scary. I'm glad everything... sounds like they worked out, but seeing an unknown fog coating and changing reality... too macabre.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well... if it led to you being who you are now, I'm glad it gave the opportunity to meet you. Thanks... Ami.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As for my world... global warming caused so many changes to our planet. Rising sea levels demolished cities and transportation. Wild weather uprooted all sorts of animals. And some parts just weren't suited for people anymore.&quot;</p>
<p>Fidgeting with her suit, she continues &quot;But the worst is the Transformation... all the color apparently disappearing. When you're grown up in this world like I have it's... no big deal to me, but from what everyone cried about, you'd think it was the world's essence itself. Seeing it for myself... maybe they had a point,&quot; she says while slowing taking in the view of the ship's hustle and bustle.</p>
<p>&quot;It's... beyond my comprehension too. Say, do you think this... host here meant what he said? About worlds, and combat, and the wishes...?&quot;</p>

<p>Ami takes a couple of moments to reflect on what Mabel has said, one hand cupping her chin in thought. &quot;I suppose in any situation there is a silver lining, isn't there, no matter how small it might be?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And yes, I do think our host means what he says... from what I've managed to gather from him and a couple of his friends aboard this ship, this death game is very much a real thing. How do you feel about it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Confused... lost... a little scared.&quot; Mabel looks downcast as she says &quot;It's the sort you imagine to be a bad dream, or perhaps a fictional tale in a discarded book... Although maybe it's better this is real to experience something new and fresh in life. A far cry from my normal life.&quot; Mabel smiles and says &quot;Bright side of life...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Exploration sounds like a big deal. Nothing bad should happen then, right...?&quot;</p>

<p>Shaking her head, Mabel responds &quot;I feel sad that... the Gods don't hold the same love of your world you do. On my world, falling rocks are familiar as well. It's hard to stay positive when problems outside your control... ruin so much... but your energy is wonderful Grug.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your coat... it's made of... light?&quot; She daintily points at Grug's wolf fur coat, asking &quot;Is that traditional wear of your world?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Even if things go bad, things can go better given time!&quot; He smiles.
He grabs a hold of the sides of his coat. &quot;It is made in the normal manner, but it is special! Shortly before Grug was awarded his position in the tribe for his achievements, a rare white buffalo was found by the hunting party! Grug was chosen to be the one to wear its skin!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Buffalo...&quot; Mabel's face scrunches up in thought, but shakes it off saying &quot;A whole tribe appointing you leader... you must be so proud for them to... trust you. Do you maybe have... family in your tribe? A wife, or children?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not leader,&quot; he corrects her. &quot;Grug holds the position of one who is to ensure the fire never goes out. Would be very difficult to start again if it did.&quot;</p>

<p>Archibald turns to the pale girl and rubs his eyes. Followed by a double take. Then a triple take. He scratches the back of his head. He cocks his head sideways. Sure enough, his sight wasn’t deceiving him. The Count cautiously approaches Mabel. “I take it you’re not one to like sunshine?” He guesses warily.</p>

<p>“Plesed to meet you, Mabel. I am Count Archibald Don Castro. Archibald or Archie is fine.” The Count appears to relax somewhat. “Don’t be afraid to speak up if you’re feeling scared or unwell.

<p>&quot;Um, yes!&quot; The words catch in her throat a bit, &quot;Everything is... weird and different and scary, like worlds getting destroyed and fighting for survival?

<p>Her words tumble out faster &quot;It's all fast and vibrant, like a waterfall rushing through my head...

<p>“Poor lass… no wonder you feel so discombobulated.” Pities Archibald with his hands on his hips. “Listen carefully, young Mable. It is perfectly reasonable to feel this way. You're young and in a unfamiliar, potentially dangerous environment. The worst thing you can do is panic. Find something you find comfort in, then find someone you can trust. It could me, or anyone you have a gut feeling on. You know, you’re around the same age as my daughter Cynthia, only less high strung. She’d get along with you.”</p>

<p><em>eeep?</em></p>
<p>A ferret slightly pokes its head from Archibald’s sleeve. This amuses the Count somewhat. “Ha! Seems like Cedric has taken an interest in you. Perhaps he too is reminded of Cynthia. You might unfortunately never see my daughter, but Cedric should make for a decent friend himself.”</p>

<p>“Unfortunately animals do have that nature of being dangerous.” Sighs the Count. “Even domestic animals like cows, horses, and even some breeds of dogs can be potentially harmful. Not Cedric though. He won’t hurt a fly! I bought him as a pet while I was staying at the United British Principalities of America. By the way, Cedric isn’t a dog, but a ferret. A black footed ferret to be precise. They’re uncommon to be owned.”</p>
<p>Cedric sniffs Mabel’s hand while glancing at the pale girl with his beady eyes and mask like face. Then the ferret begins cutely licking her fingers.</p>

<p>“Oh, the United British Principalities of America?” Archibald prepares himself for an extended explanation. “That’s the country in between Canada and Mexico in North America. It was formed after the rebelling colonists lost during the Reclamation War. Its served as the Great British Empire’s largest satellite nation in the world. However, recent tensions have started rising again, and there signs that a second attempted revolution may come to pass someday.”</p>
<p>The gentleman faces his head towards the ceiling, his eyes closed in retrospection. “Now this New York… that exists too in the UBP! Wonderful place to visit. I went to a cricket game once and saw their city team play: the New York Yahoos. I’m sure its just as magical where you live as well.”</p>

<p>Mabel slowly pets the ferret while taking in Archibald's words. &quot;It's... strange. A week ago I wouldn't have cared about any of this... not my world, or my life, or my future. It could come and go like a sigh in the wind, unnoticed. It's... safe to say my people would agree too. Maybe a higher power out there somewhere... would agree humans brought this on ourselves.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But ever since arriving here, and getting thrown into so much new stuff, and meeting a wonderful person like you and Cedric, it's changed.&quot; She pauses, and whispers &quot;I'm sorry... you, Cedric, are a ferret. Not a person,&quot; with utmost sincerity.</p>
<p>&quot;I... don't want to see my world lost and broken. Somehow, whether it takes a week or a month or a lifetime, things can be fixed. I'm sure... I know it can. Like... hope...? Suddenly taking root? Ahaha, I don't know where this is coming from all of a sudden, but it feels comforting.&quot;</p>
<p>As she stares at a wall of the spaceship, she continues &quot;And I hope you make it safely home too, Archie. Everything I knew used to be compact like a cube, and... after seeing it expand into the starry outer skies like now... I don't want to lose it. To lose you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oops, sorry about that,&quot; Benjamin mentions as the girl goes to take her seat. He quickly gives his phone a double tap and a swipe as the light emanating from it drastically dies down. &quot;Hope that wasn't bothering you too much.&quot;</p>
<p>The man approaches, bending down to offer a hand. &quot;The name's Benjamin. Benjamin Trout.&quot;</p>

<p>The girl has her hand up to her head in discomfort. Upon the man's introduction, she peers open her eyes for several seconds, in silence.</p>
<p>But eventually she daintily shakes the man's hand. &quot;Mabel Sinclair,&quot; she responds. &quot;There's no need to apologize. All the... intensity... of everything... is this color?&quot; she asks without a hint of irony.</p>

<p>Benjamin stands up straight and peers around at the various curious doodads that litter the hall. <em>Click</em>. The phone sounds off as he points it at various oddities.</p>
<p>&quot;It <em>is</em> all a bit much, isn't it?&quot; the man answers, pocketing the phone. &quot;Especially given the circumstances. Nothing says death sentence quite like all these colorful displays.&quot;</p>
<p>He reaches into a side pocket of his suit, presenting a pair of ordinary sunglasses to Mabel. &quot;If it's too bright in here, you can have these. Keep them on me whenever I'm out in the garden.&quot;</p>

<p>Benjamin puts back the glasses. &quot;I do! Too many to count really. The Lord insists on having a grand garden he can show off to guests, but refuses to hire anymore help. Must spend half my day tending to it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Actually,&quot; he begins, taking a seat next to the girl and retrieving back his phone. &quot;I can show you!&quot; After a few taps, he begins swiping through some photos while angling the screen so Mabel can view it. &quot;Hopefully it's not too bright or, um, colorful for your tastes.&quot;</p>

<p>Mabel's face light up at the expansive gorgeous garden shown on his screen. &quot;Ah... it looks so brilliant! You must be so happy every day with beautiful plants to tend and grow, just you and the flowers as far as can see, like a movie...&quot;</p>
<p>After a few moments, she confesses &quot;I just... haven't seen flora so wonderful before. Not only from my eyes, but... your home and skies look so healthy... and isn't touched from global warming like mine, I'm guessing... Is that true?&quot; she asks, still glued to the phone's pictures.</p>

<p>&quot;Heh, perhaps not to the same degree, at least, though globabl warming is certainly an issue for us as well. Suppose in that regard, I am blessed to have what I have.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm almost afraid to ask,&quot; Benjamin readies hesitantly, turning to Mabel. &quot;Your world... None of this exists? Like anywhere? Just to be clear, not every place where is as green and vibrant. Even we have wastelands of death and cities with thick, clouded air.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah...&quot; Mabel is silent.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything on Earth is shades of light and dark. It's all ruined, not just the intensity, but... humanity too... civilization, I suppose...? Or that's what people say about the cities I know anyways, especially not the dedication you have, Benjamin, to... create something as beautiful as this. Not me, either. Everywhere is ruined in its own way, with people telling me 'Things used to be different', or something... and they'd leave it at that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was born before the Transformation, so my life  entirely like this... in a way, it's hard explaining this to someone who doesn't know... something ever-present to everyone.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's sad to hear not everywhere on your Earth is like that, but, just knowing your garden exists makes it paradise, right?&quot; she beams with a smile. &quot;Maybe perfect, in its own way...&quot;</p>

<p>A door, previously closed, slides open. Lights flicker on, flooding the interior with soft lighting as smooth jazz begins floating through the air. Fireplaces seemingly light themselves, and bulkhead shutters raise, revealing windows looking out on the endless expanse of space. The interior of the bar appears overly opulent to the point of appearing tacky. Golds, Silvers, and Coppers adorn every surface of the bar. Surfaces are covered in soft, plush red velvet seats. Drinking vessels in varying shapes made of crystal line the back wall, your preferred drinking glass mixed in among various shapes you’ve never seen before, each inlaid with gold in various complimentary designs.</p>
<p>A purple cloud coalesces behind the bar, which has multiple segments at varying heights, allowing you to easily find one which is at your preferred height. Chairs made of gold are topped with red velvet plush seating, placed with purpose in front of their respective height at the bar. The purple cloud then twists, swirls, and a portion of the cloud appears to shift into a face.</p>
<p>A voice is audible from the air itself throughout the ship.</p>
<p>“’Dive’ is now open. Come in and relax. Enjoy the best drinks in the multiverse, on the house, thanks to the beneficent good will of Emperor Maximilian Von Blitz.&quot;</p>

<p><em>I suppose I can try some intergalactic booze at least once in my life,</em> Ami thinks to herself as she finds a comfortable seat at the bar. All the strange sights are eye-candy to her, not the least of which being the face-shaped purple cloud behind the counter. She clears her throat and raises a hand slightly to catch its attention.</p>

<p>&quot;E-excuse me! Do you have any more... mild drinks to recommend to a traveler? I'm very impressed by your selection here!&quot;</p>

<p>Aggy's face dissipates from facing one patron, and reappears an instant later facing Ami. The same unblinking, unmoving face seems to be 'looking' at you as you hear a voice come from their general direction.</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly. I'm permitted to dispense any beverage or nourishment determined to not be hazardous to anyone aboard.&quot;</p>
<p>The face shimmers as Aggy falls silent. The edges of his face becoming blurrier, as the cloud seems to lose some mass, and you feel a very light tingling sensation across your skin.</p>
<p>&quot;Might I recommend a Maple Mule? Or perhaps a Oak Sour with a twist of orange peel&quot;</p>

<p>Aggy's face again flickers from existence, and the cloud swirls for an instant before reforming to face Archibald. Before answering, Aggy's face again loses some definition on the edges, as he appears to lose mass in his cloud and you feel a very light tingling sensation across your exposed hands. As soon as the sensation stops his face regains definition along the edges and a voice comes from his mass.</p>
<p>&quot;Coming right up, on the house.&quot;</p>
<p>Aggy's cloud reaches out to a glass more closely resembling a <a href="https://i.imgur.com/NkEA8sV.png">Collins glass</a>, the cloud cupping the bottom and entire height of the walls of the glass in a thin layer purple cloud, floating the glass to the counter in front of him.</p>
<p>The cloud shifts slightly forward. The purple mass of their body over the glass as his face dissipates, and you begin <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Mn4so2f.png">seeing flash after flash of light from within the cloud</a>. 20 seconds later, the cloud floats backward in the air, and Aggy's face reappears on the surface of their cloud. The cloud reveals a full glass of bubble tea, caramel sauce drizzled along the inside of the glass, a layer of boba at the bottom, and a wide mouth straw settled in an almost picturesque positioning within the glass.</p>
<p>&quot;<a href="https://i.imgur.com/j95QR28.png">Your bubble tea</a>, Mr. Archibald.&quot;</p>
<p>||The bubble tea tastes exactly as you expect. The tea is cold, crisp, and tastes like a good quality tea was used, along with grass fed cow milk. The boba tastes sweet, pops easily in your mouth with the slightest pressure, and blends together exactly as you might expect.||</p>
<p>&quot;How are you enjoying the amenities aboard the craft?&quot;</p>

<p>Aggy's face holds on Ami, as a tendril of cloud reaches out behind him, and picks up a <a href="https://i.imgur.com/tilc5ij.png">drinking horn made of crystal</a>.</p>
<p>&quot;An Oak Sour, coming right now, Lady Ami.&quot;</p>
<p>The drinking horn is cradled in a thin layer of purple cloud, placed daintily on the counter in front of you, and their face dissipates from the cloud as it hovers closer, obscuring your view of the drinking horn.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/Mn4so2f.png">Flashes of light from within the cloud occur from various locations</a>, in varying intensity, for 30 seconds, before revealing a <a href="https://i.imgur.com/39fe1sd.png">blue cocktail</a>. Leaves of oak and mint are mixed throughout the lightly iced drink, and 3 olives are laid atop on a piece of sugarcane placed over the rim of the glass.</p>
<p>&quot;Your Oak Sour, Lady Ami.&quot;</p>
<p>||It tastes of notes of trees long gone. Earth, solid, and hearty, the very light addition of sour lemon schnapps paired with the natural oils in the orange peel providing the drink a rounded out flavor profile that is overall pleasing, but not overwhelming.||</p>
<p>&quot;Do you find the furnishings of the ship pleasing, Lady Ami? One would imagine it is a vast difference from the place you left.&quot;</p>

<p>Ami takes a moment to breathe in the aroma of the cocktail before taking a sip. Beneath her mushroom cap, her eyes light up and she smiles warmly. &quot;Oh, this flavor profile is so comforting and bright - just what I was hoping for. Thank you very much.&quot;</p>

<p>After a moment, she sets her drinking horn down and adds, &quot;Yes, so far I've found the amenities of this ship to be very luxurious. This is unlike anything I've ever experienced before, for sure. Are you always aboard the Prosit, or do you travel abroad as well?&quot;</p>

<p>Archibald studies the glass carefully. After a few seconds he takes a sip. He raises his eyebrows, then takes another sip. The Count nods approvingly. “I’ll admit, this isn't the kind of bubble tea I’m used to. Usually I prefer strawberry. However, this serves as a fine drink. Much appreciated.” He sits back and listens in on the conversation with Ami with interest.</p>

<p>Archibald casually waves back to the mushroom lady. “Hello again Ms. Ami! This is my preferred drink, bubble tea. Much tastier than the bland old pretentious drink that is <em>regular</em> tea.” He scoffs. “So you have a similar drink in your world ey? I can confirm that algae has never been an ingredient in these. Seems as if you’re enjoying your own there.” The gentleman eyes the Oak Sour in her hand.</p>
<p>“Seems like we’re here for a similar purpose. Aggy is one person said to have answers as Max implied.”</p>

<p>Aggy's face remains in the same stoic expression as an answer comes from his cloud.</p>
<p>&quot;It pleases me to know you enjoy the amenities of the ship. I believe I speak for all aboard the Prosit when I say we hope you continue to enjoy your time aboard.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I collect data from every world visited, which is then stored and catalogued for future reference, should it ever be needed. I am presently located across the 17 earths currently participating in the event. I am also cataloguing those findings. And serving the patrons here, of course.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Much apologies, Mr. Archibald. I can assure you the next drink will contain a strawberry simple syrup, should you wish for another. A simple correction that should accomodate one's preferences.&quot;</p>
<p>Aggy's face continues gazing at you, although it doesn't <em>feel</em> like a being's gaze. Perhaps more like being on camera in public. Their unmoving face flickers for just a moment before continuing.</p>
<p>&quot;I may have information. It would depend on the question. I must adhere to the wishes of our beneficent ruler, of course.&quot;</p>

<p>Aggy is quiet for a long moment, but it is difficult to discern why from their emotionless, unmoving 'face'. Their voice suddenly breaking the silence with a response.</p>

&quot;This would be 686,567th event I have taken part in. At present We have catalogued 13,731,300 worlds to completion in the <strong>Library</strong>, which I catalogue and operate. I also organize the catalogued worlds as a tertiary duty using any spare processing power I have.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So Maximilian must be quite old, then,&quot; Ami ponders. &quot;Or at least very efficient in his conquest. What else do you have in the Library? Intergalactic literature?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Maximilian has not appeared to age a day since I was first ... acquired, yes. I do not know how old our generous benefactor might be.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I catalogue every piece of information I am able to glean from the planets we visit, prior to their scheduled termination. If there is an interconnected data transfer network, I download its contents. We also catalogue one of every object. If you have time, I might recommend you visit merely to see the Red Dragon kept within. I understand this creature to be a common myth on nearly every earth thus far.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Quite real, and quite a sight to behold soaring through the sky. The apex predator above all others on Earth-12. Unfortunately not sapient, they were unable to be considered for the event. Therefore, the dragons have been relegated to the archives.&quot;</p>

<p>Aggy is silent for a moment, before continuing.</p>
<p>&quot;We have found ... living trees, an entire planet of sentient plants, a society not dissimilar to goblins and orcs, humans that lived underground to hide from acidic rain, and became similar in appearance to Dwarves. But nothing resembling Magic, nothing unexplainable by scientific review.&quot;</p>

<p>Grug enters into the fancy room. He wastes no time in turning over the velvet seats, looking them over one by one before zooming on to the next thing that catches his eye, running his hands over the bar and other ornate things, before turning his attention to Aggy. &quot;You do not look like a God. But you are not one of us. Drinks? You make drinks? Do you make water?&quot;</p>

<p>Aggy's 'face' dissipates into the cloud before rapidly forming again directly facing Grug as his deadpan monotone voice emanates from his cloud.</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly, Sir Grug.&quot;</p>
<p>Aggy's tendrils of cloud reach out and pick up a familiar shape, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/gFyrKDo.png">oddly resembling a waterskin</a>, and carries it carefully back to the counter, before hovering over the opening.</p>
<p>Aggy's face dissipates as <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Mn4so2f.png">flecks of light flash in an inconsistent pattern across his body</a>, before he moves back, leaving a filled container of water on the countertop in front of Grug.</p>
<p>&quot;I trust the furnishings of the Prosit are to your liking thus far, Sir Grug?&quot;</p>

<p>Aggy's expressionless stare continues unabated.</p>
<p>&quot;It is pure dihydrogen monoxide for consumption. Perhaps your body requires additional minerals to find it pleasing. One moment.&quot;</p>
<p>Aggy reaches a tendril of his form out over the opening of the waterskin, the flashing light concentrated directly over the waterskin. Fine particulate dust seems to float into the waterskin.</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps this will make the water more to your liking?&quot;</p>
<p>||The water shifts, from a stale, pure H20 flavor, to something slightly more chalky, similar to aquifina||</p>

<p>Aggy does not flinch or respond to your hand entering his form.</p>

<p>Aggy pulls a plate out of the shelf beneath the bar and flickers, flashes of light emanating from his form for 70 seconds before he reveals a <a href="https://i.imgur.com/3eTHeO6.png">plate of steak</a>.</p>

<p>&quot;Mphfch&quot; Grug sort of tries to speak with his mouth full, but realizes it's entirely too full and so spends some time finishing up the steak before continuing. &quot;Was Emperor Maximilian like Grug once? In more than eating 'steak'?&quot;</p>

Finding herself equidistant from many rooms of interest, she cups her hands around her mouth in preparation to call out to everyone. &quot;<strong>My friends, and more importantly my foes!

Several other tentacles appear all of a sudden one holding an electric kettle made out of a bone-like material with strange rune-like engravings glowing red. The others hold a box with a large assortment of tea and instant coffee, one of which Z picks out and pours into his cup, the tentacles working together to make a fresh cup of coffee</p>

<p>&quot;My my! A gift from the gods? I never knew them to be real. You must have been steadfast in your worship to have earned such an incredible gift.&quot;</p>

<p>The tentacles start to prepare Yumi her own cup as Z continues taking a sip from his own fresh one and giving a sigh of satisfaction.</p>
<p>&quot;Words hold great weight in this existence of ours. How about you start by telling me about just where it is your from that has you speaking so brazenly about this situation we're in. Oh and your name of course too&quot; Z say with a wink taking another sip</p>

<p>With a light blush of embarrassment, Yumi begins her introduction. From the sudden shift to formality, its fairly obvious this routine has been burned into her brain.</p>
<p>&quot;Yumi Dae, Director of the S. Section 3 of the Chi Association.&quot;</p>
<p>She pauses, &quot;Though I suppose that wouldn't mean anything to anyone on this ship. -- My company, the Chi, is in charge of expeditions, and land reclamation in the wasteland that from our city. Its a dangerous job, but a necessary one. Since you never know whether or not today will be your last, it teaches you to live without regrets.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, but back to what you were asking about. My earth... With just three habitable cities remaining in the world and vastly limited arable land, for every person who eats a full meal, there is another who goes to bed hungry.&quot; Yumi shakes her head. &quot;As a result, the backstreets are filled with murder and fraud and there is conflict between the cities. The value of a human life isn't what it should be back home.&quot;</p>
<p>Noticing her retelling getting more down, she changes the topic back to before &quot;So! If we are to take the lives of one another, it should be done with respect and understanding; especially with stakes like these. Before the Chi Association, I worked with law enforcement. I've seen too many empty killings...&quot; She trails off before looking back up expectantly.</p>

<p>Z's expression slowly changes to one of worry and sadness as he hears of the homeland of this young girl.  She reads off her rank and position like a soldier. His face starts to look even sadder before he takes a deep breath and sighs sipping his coffee.</p>
<p>&quot;That is...quite the brutal place you call home. You truly must be of strong conviction to survive there...are you okay?&quot;</p>
<p>Z starts to reach out towards Yumi before remembering his place, deciding instead to reach into his robe and pull out a photo of a family with 3 young children.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you...okay?&quot;</p>

<p>She shrugs nonchalantly, &quot;This is this, and that is that. Only so much one person can do against the riptide that is the world! Though, I must say, working out in the field is a nice escape from the city. I get to be surrounded by companions I trust with my life.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm alive, breathing, meeting all sorts of new and strange people today. All things considered, minus this sick contest, I've never been better! -- Thank you for asking though, the sentiment is appreciated.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah of course how could I forget&quot; Z's tentacles begin to move with speed and grace pulling out the instant coffee clean cup and electric kettle all working in unison to pour a warm cup of coffee before handing it to you.</p>
<p>&quot;As promised. I know I said I'd speak a bit more on my home but...if I  may be so bold. Your world has lost much it sounds like and not much is left...even if this game goes through and you somehow do win...do you believe your world to be the one that truly deserves it the most? What of the other worlds that are flourishing and those that have no such extreme fight for survival?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I mean no offense either. Were it possible I'd try to assemble as many as we could to rise against our captors here and allow all the worlds exist harmoniously&quot;</p>

<p>Yumi accepts the coffee graciously, deeply breathing in the smell before taking a sip and relishing the taste of a new experience. It is obvious that she is very thankful to have tried Z's coffee.</p>
<p>Yumi appears nonchalant. &quot;Not to worry my friend, no offence taken. That exact conundrum is something I've been ruminating about since I've arrived here. This game, however, allows one to bring great change to their world.&quot;</p>
<p>Yumi's eyes glow with an unseen optimism. &quot;I can shake the foundation of corruption that my earth is built upon. What do you think would happen if you were to remove 30 people from power from your world? Would it not spark opportunity for change?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Alas, despite the state of my earth, that does not mean it is any more or less deserving than another. The issue is simply too complex to answer without bias. It is not so different than the trolley problem.&quot;</p>

<p>Z's face turns from one lost in thought to one of joy as he begins laughing seeming to realize his own hole in his logic behind his question. Raising his cup before drink from it he gives another chuckle seeming to relax a bit at Yumi's answer.</p>
<p>&quot;You're truly one of the more interesting ones I've met here, Yumi. An enigma amongst enigmas. I think perhaps I've misjudged you and our situation...still it's far from a happy one for me. I've been taught my whole life to cherish the life given and lives around us. Each soul is sacred each being it's own creation in its own way. It's vile to put people against one another for lives that never even had a chance or choice. Especially when we could have gone on living in peace if not for our captor's own boredome and greed.&quot;</p>

<p>Sympathetically in aggreance, &quot;I'm with you there Z, the situation that we've been forced into is... as you said; absolutely vile and terrible unfortunate. I'd rather not have this the way change is brought to my world, but in trying to find the silver lining we can reach out and take back what little control that we have left. Lets try to make the best of our time here as captives.&quot;</p>
<p>Savoring the cup, &quot;I'm glad we were able to meet like this. Oh, and thank you for the coffee by the way, it's truly a wonderful flavor.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm glad you enjoy it. It's one of my own personal blends. Now then I suppose I still have my home to tell you about, don't I?&quot; Z said sipping his own coffee before producing a scroll</p>

<p>Z unfurls the scroll and starts speaking in a strange unintelligible tongue. As he does so the scroll starts to glow, strange alien-like runes turning a mixture of reds greens and blues until a hollogram appears above it, depicting a massive beast rising from the ocean with clawed hands and a tentacled maw reaching out over a group of humans on a cliff both reaching out to each other</p>
<p>&quot;In the beginning when mankind had gained sentience the Great Old Ones reveleaed themselves to us and offered us a choice. We could continue onward with our existence or be a part of something much greater. For the worship of the Great Old Gods, in return they would give us gifts and blessings the likes at the time were unimaginable. Man took this opportunity and so for all of time we have built shrines and constructed great cities in reverence of the Great Old Gods and their Pantheon. Over the short years of humanity's existence they've given us a great many things, technology to power our homes, to carry us from one place to another and in turn humanity even improved on these creations, surprising our gods in our cleverness.&quot;</p>
<p>The hologram shifts to a modern day city, clouds covering the sky softly drizzling rain on a large group of humans and strange alien creatures alike waiting in front of a train station.</p>
<p>&quot;we've learned to live alongside other creations of the gods and spend much of our time worshipping and working towards the god's design. Still we are granted time plenty for our interests and recreation. It's a peaceful life for the most part but there are creations of the gods that are more unsavory that need dealing with&quot;</p>

<p>Hearing Yumi's announcement, Ami casually makes her way over to the table. &quot;Quite the dramatic entrance, miss,&quot; she laughs, looking up at Yumi. &quot;I'm sure you can tell just by looking at me that I come from a much different world than your own. I'm very interested to know about your world as well.&quot;</p>

<p>Having caught the attention of a very interesting individual, Yumi responds Triumphantly: &quot;Yes! Of course. Being overly dramatic is a guilty pleasure of mine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then today, Yumi shall treat you with the tale of my people!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Ten days of Twilight, as it is now known began with a dawn that never came.&quot; Yumi extends her pointer, pointing towards the heavens. &quot;Before the sky had risen, the sky began to shimmer a subtle translucent blue. Soon after, bright rays of sunshine filled the sky, but alas the sun had not moved. This, my friend, was the beginning of the end.&quot;</p>
<h1>DRAMATIC PAUSE</h1>
<p>&quot;The people of the three cities that remain today had known no better at the time. But those who found themselves outside what seemed to be a barrier, were all too aware of changes that had occurred. First electronics stopped working. I'm sure you know what that means; critical infrastructure failures, loss of communications, and of course the great loss of information and the internet.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;By the second day, there had been 24 hours of twilight in the cities. People realized and panic set in, but nobody could come or go. By the end of the tenth day of twilight the sun finally rose upon the cities. But alas, it was too late. In just 240 hours, half the earth came became scorched, the other half frozen. Completely uninhabitable.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The magnetic field of the earth lost composure and cosmic rays began to beat down upon it. The results of this phenomenon are what my people call the corruption.  I of course, explore the corruption and exterminate monsters within! And the rest, however? history!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now miss, I'd be honored to hear your of your name and your story.&quot;</p>

										</div>										<div class='conversation-post-body'>
<p>Ami nods her head, intrigued by Yumi's story. &quot;I see, your world has been through some harsh changes, not too different from my own.&quot;</p>

<p>Pulling a chair out from beneath the table, Ami takes a seat and crosses a leg over one knee and clears her throat. &quot;I suppose, if you really want to know, I can give you the shortened version of what happened on my world. You see, about thirty years ago, a team of scientists and secret military personnel from around the world began researching an alien object found in the middle of a desert. The object looked very similar to any ordinary box, but it was made of an alien material and there was no obvious way to open it. Long story short, the scientists managed to crack open the box after a couple years of research, and things slowly became Altered around the world.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Altering began just in the camp it was being researched at, and the scientists tried to keep it contained, to no avail. Within 5 years, the entire globe changed dramatically. The atmosphere became toxic to normal humans, the animals and plants evolved very rapidly, and people developed strange mutations as well. I've always been a plant-person... I have no memory of what the world was like before the Altering. Back home, my best friend and I have dedicated several years to researching fungi and the effects they could have on our health, especially in the world's new atmosphere.&quot;</p>

<p>Intrigued, &quot;Wow! Your earth is truly fascinating. I never would have imagined the earth was capable of a biological reconstruction in such a short time span. In a way, it gives me hope for my home world to be able to find a solution to their own problems.&quot;</p>
<p>Inquisitive, Yumi respectfully asks some more questions. &quot;You say you've got no memory of the world before the altering-- distinctly different from being born after it. Is there a possibility, perchance, that you were once human before the altering? Or if your best friend is as well? Have you memories of each other before you turned into plant people?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Regardless, it sounds like you've been well since the changes in the world. It is good to hear that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My best friend and I were never fully human,&quot; Ami explains. &quot;We were born plantfolk. The Altering had fully settled into the Earth a couple of years before we were born, so we've never physically witnessed what the world was like beforehand. I have seen several photographs from my parents and other elders, though, and it is fascinating to compare that world to the one I've known my entire life.&quot;</p>

<p>Yumi puts on a temporary 'teaching persona' and wags her finger. &quot;The most dangerous, however, are those that work together. You can never be too careful when the get smart, y'know? They've been known to wipe out even the most cautious crews.&quot;</p>

<p>The door slides open with a swish, and you step into some sort of foundry or laboratory.</p>
<p>The looks of it all are a far cry from the sci-fi feel you've been accustomed to. It appears like someone had grabbed a bunch of random technology from the industrial ages of various worlds and crammed them all in a single room. Desks and complex machinery are scattered around with no rime or reason, forming a labyrinthine web of corridors. Humming tubes pour liquids in vats with so many danger symbols that you start questioning your well-being by just looking at them. Scalding hot ovens and surfaces are pepper throughout, making your traversal dangerous and unsteady.</p>
<p>In the center, the roof opens into a semicircular transparent dome. The stars can be seen through the thick looking glass. A pointy turret turns on itself in the middle, accompanied by a loud whirr. Suddenly, a deafening boom shakes the room. A single blinding laser of orange and yellow energy bursts from the weapon and loses itself in the sky. Some seconds later, a distant light pops and it's gone.</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>WOOHOO! THAT WAS A BIG ONE! SHIT, I WANTED TO SEE IT UP CLOSE!</strong>&quot; a man jumps down from the turret cockpit and right in front of you. &quot;<strong>I'M BLAST! YOU GUYS ARE THE NEW ONES FOR THE GAME UH? ONLY ONE RULE FOR ME: THE BIGGER THE EXPLOSION, THE BETTER!</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Henry picks his way past the jumble of machinery and hazardous material before coming to a halt a few feet away from Blast. He takes one look around at all the explosive materials and quickly puts out his cigar on the bottom of his heel.</p>
<p>“What the hell is going on?” Says Henry, while using his golf club to gingerly push away a nearby canister that looks suspiciously like a grenade.</p>
<p>“Why are you blowing shit up? Are you in charge here?”</p>

<p>&quot;<strong>WHY? HERE'S A BETTER QUESTION: WHY ARE YOU <em>NOT</em> BLOWING SHIT UP?</strong>&quot; Blast points a finger at Henry, then at the turret. &quot;<strong>GET A SEAT! POINT IT AT A PLANET YOU DON'T LIKE AND FUCK IT UP! TAKE THAT, PROXIMA CENTAURI!</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Henry’s look of annoyance disappears faster than whatever it was that Blast had blown up. He smiles a toothy grin and walks over to the turret seat. He fumbles with the controls for a bit before managing to point the turret at a particularly unassuming dot in space.</p>
<p>“I would have paid good money to do this back home.” He says, still grinning, and pulls what is probably the trigger.</p>

<p>As Henry pulls the trigger, the whole turret starts buzzing with a high pitched whine. While the auto-targeting works its magic, several indicators move on red. The noise grows into a roar.</p>
<p>A massive pulse of orange-red light gets ejected from the nozzle. Henry is shaken by powerful vibrations that traverse the whole structure. Then things calm down.</p>
<p>After almost a minute of pause, a screen lights up on the right hand side of the screen. A blue gas giant lazily spins on itself, orbited by a massive billboard with Maximillian's face and lines of alien writing on it. Moments after, the laser reaches its destination, piercing through the billboard and Maximillian's portrait like butter, and diving into the placid blue of the planet. Colors change, blue to violet to a bubbling red, then the screen is filled with a colorful explosion and drifts to static.</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>HA! SQUARE IN THE NOGGIN! NATURAL TALENT!</strong>&quot; Blast gives the other man a couple of claps &quot;<strong>DO THE SAME TO YOUR FRIENDS HERE, AND WE WILL HAVE AN INCREDIBLE GAME! MAYBE YOU WILL BE... <em>THE ONE!</em></strong>&quot;</p>
<p>While he speaks, the dot in the sky Henry had pointed at gets brighter for a moment, then dims considerably.</p>

<p>A bruised and scared looking red chair looks around the room for her abuser before she was brought onboard the ship. A quick sigh of relief as she finds he is not here.</p>
<p>Then her face drops, the red fabric around her face goes a paler shade of red. &quot;W-why are humans walking and talking!?....... AND WHERE IS MY DUAGHTER! Karla! Karla, where are you! She approaches the nearest group of moving humans. &quot;Have you seen my daughter? She looks like me but only smaller. Please tell me if you've seen her.&quot;</p>

<p>Archibald had many questions as soon as he saw a sentient chair of all things speaking, but her near hysterical response and the mention of a daughter caused him to drop all such inquiries. The Count rushes over to Janeet. “I hate to say this, but it’s highly likely your child has been left behind in whatever world you were in. Your concern is natural. I too have a daughter, but I assume she’s still safely at school. Where was Karla last seen? Could she currently be in danger?”</p>

<p>&quot;Oh.... I see, so she's been left behind... A-and yes she is in danger. Chairster treatens that if I leave him he will hurt me and my daughter. But as I have somehow been taken away to here he is likely to beat her almost to death if not kill her. I really pray that she is ok.&quot;</p>
<p>She sighs trying to calm her self. &quot;You also have a daughter? What will happen to her after she gets home and finds you not there? Oh excuse me I've forgot to introduce my self! My name is Janeet Charison. What is your name?&quot;</p>

<p>The Count scowls in disgust. “What a scoundrel! Hurting women and children like that! I certainly hope that’s not your spouse you’re referring to. Let’s hope there is no passage of time while we’re all here in who knows where.”</p>
<p>“Yes, my child’s name is Cynthia. Don’t worry, she’s in good hands. My daughter attends a private school in British India, so she’ll have a dormitory to return to. It’s a pleasure to meet you, Ms. Chairson. I am Archibald Don Castro. Feel free to refer me simply Archibald or Archie.” He almost extends out hand to shake with, but upon realizing the potential awkwardness given Janeet’s physique(?), he simply nods his head to introduce himself.</p>

<p>Janeet smiles. &quot;Cynthia is a nice name, a strong name. And its good to hear she will be fine at your disappearance.&quot;
Janeets right arm on the chair moves slightly and what looks like a hand in a mitten pushes through the arm as if a human hand was trying to escape. &quot;We are still able to shake hands. But thank you for the respect when you did not know. So thank you. ah Archie?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And sadlly yes he is my spouse but there is no longer any love there. Only hatred and despair. I pray there is passage of time.&quot; She looks sad. &quot;Archiebald Don Castro, would you help me in getting home to my daughter? Or perhaps finding her here?&quot;</p>

<p>Archibald appears simply aghast when he listens to Janeet’s horror story. “How reprehensible of him! To treat his own wife and child with such brutality. I hope that horrible man will be incarcerated for his heinous actions someday. And of course I’ll assist you in returning to your daughter. As a parent myself, I’m aware of how much stress and anxiety we endure concerning our children’s wellbeing.”</p>
<p>Realizing the chair was capable, as well as willing, of something like a handshake, he bends down and offers his hand.</p>

<p>Yumi's head turns at the sudden shout. Her eyes dart around looking for the source of the noise. First across the room, then at the balcony on top, then the entrances and exits of the room. She spots nothing.</p>

I could even give you a free serive, anything you want to do with me you can. I don't care what Chaister would do to me after but if I can get my daughter back its worth it.&quot;</p>

<p>After the night passes Janeet finds Xerio once again. &quot;What a night that was. If you could call it a night.&quot;
Stopping for a moment she frowns. &quot;It was Xerio right? Sorry for leaving in such a rush. And if I remember correctly you asked what I was doing before I arriaved here? Well..... Lets see. I last thing I remember was falling asleep watching my daughter to make sure Chairster didn't try anything.&quot; Looking sad she sighs. &quot;Who knows what would have happened to her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It was definitely something that's for sure. I'm still trying to sort everything out in my head.&quot;
Xerio seems a bit out of it after the night, like his mind is racing and feels a bit distracted. He takes a deep breathe and chuckles.
&quot; Ah yes Ms. Chairson, Xerio is my name and helping you will be my game. I have a question if you don't mind me asking, who is exactly Chairster?&quot;
He asks somewhat carefully, he can tell that Chairster seems to be a sore topic.</p>

<p>With a scowl she looks at Xerio but its not directed at him. &quot;I guess you could say my husband, but I hate his guts. I can't leave him cuz he will get his men to kill me and my daughter.  And not like I can fight back, hell just hit harder and beat me near death.&quot;</p>

<p>A look of concern crosses Xerio's face, he is obviously remembering some memories he is not a fan of.
&quot;Janeet do not worry, his kind always get what's coming to them ten fold and if be some chance he is here then we can easily rectify the mistake he made of having you and your child's life in danger.&quot;, Xerio says this we a seriousness that is held by the confidence of someone who has taken care of the <em>trash</em> too many times.
&quot; Have you learned anything that may give you leads on where your daughter may be? Or any people you have come across that may have clues on where to go from here?&quot;</p>

<p>Over several minutes the lights in the central party hall begin to dim. Most of the various peoples mingling here and there begin to filter out, leaving the space at a fraction of its original capacity. The music comes to a stop as a bright beam of radiant light shines atop the throne.</p>
<p>Maximillian stands up. He raises his golden scepter forward and speaks, his voice booming out to all in the hall just as a new song begins to emanate throughout the space. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zg7-71pMRiA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zg7-71pMRiA</a></p>
<p><strong>&quot;Our first day draws on its second half and We are unsatisfied!&quot;</strong></p>
<p>The man's attire suddenly changes; his decorated military uniform is replaced with a stylish black suit, the crown on his head vanishes and instead a pair of sunglasses now covers his eyes. He begins to clap as he dances down the steps, speaking the entire way, &quot;We party to the fortune of the champions. Let any beckon their inner callings and speak to Us and all. <strong>Seek out the Curators, here or in their abodes so to learn the secrets of tonight's rooms!</strong> Prosit!&quot; Maximillian grabs a glass from a nearby waiter, drinks, and throws the glass onto the ground. From out of the woodwork a group of similarly dressed men join Maximillian in their cheer and form a conga-line with the Architect, following him as he dances throughout the party hall. <a href="https://imgur.com/VFyB8mB">https://imgur.com/VFyB8mB</a></p>

<p>Her attention snaps toward the voice of the man she loathes. She listens as he speaks, fire burning in her even greater with every word that emanates from his upturned lips. The flame’s are expanding, she can feel it. The dangerous blood thirsty <em><strong>rage</strong></em> at being trapped, held hostage, made to do something she has no will to participate in, forced to fight and kill to survive as if she were still stuck in that facility - Still controlled by a foolhardy man in power that believes himself the god over <em>her</em> life. Fists turn in toward themselves, nails digging into her own palms. But she doesn’t wince at the pain. It fuels her. Harrow is far too distracted by the bile of words creeping up her throat that, with every happy dance move he makes, she loses the control to contain.</p>
<p><em>Fuck it</em>, she thinks, bringing her voice to a full on amplified yell, yet seemingly still talking in a normal tone. Not screaming, just speaking somehow louder than the commotion in furious spit heavy judgements aimed directly at Maximillian and his cohorts.</p>
<p>“You party to <em>our</em> fortune?! Or do you party to the enjoyment you will receive from seeing us all disembowel one another for survival?!” Her eyes look directly at the goddamn sunglasses covering his eyes.</p>
<p>“And how exactly -pray tell- are we supposed to find these ‘curators’ of yours? Why not just tell us who they are?!” <em>And quit playing your fucking games</em>, she wants to add but doesn’t. He likes games, the game is part of the fun. Or so she assumes from her experience of people like him that the ex-centurion knew all too well.</p>

<p>The conga-line begins to slow down and circle Harrow as she speaks.</p>
<p>Suddenly the music stops. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6JY4WhAKPI">A new, low rumbling begins to fill the party hall as something else begins to play</a>. He lifts an arm, halting his train of party goers. Looking right at Harrow, he stares without word, their gazes locked. He is silent for nearly a half a minute. &quot;...Yes, for without it We could not be satisfied.&quot; <a href="https://youtu.be/r6JY4WhAKPI?t=57">He turns to look away as the music reaches an apex</a>. Where his night sights lie a spotlight of radiant brilliance  begin to illuminates a portion of the room only a dozen feet away. A hole in the ground opens up as smoke billows upward, exposing with it a tray of glowing alcoholic drinks alongside a strange purple cloud .</p>
<p>&quot;No party is without such delights. None of Our design, at least.&quot; Maximillian turns to look back at Harrow. &quot;Apologies, you were saying? Ah, yes, you inquired of Our celebration and Arbiters. Yes to your fortune and our entertainment. The Curators will make themselves known.&quot; With a tap of his staff against the floor the conga-line of merry dancing men begins anew, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfF0zHeU3Zs">marching to a new song altogether</a>.</p>

<p>Upon making his eclectic entrance, Aggy presents a suitable fascimile of a face and <a href="https://i.imgur.com/6azWplt.png">offers the selection of beverages</a>, first to Maximillian von Blitz , then to Harrow .</p>
<p>&quot;If I may, I recommend the white beverage, sir. It is based on the 2018 Alsace Riesling selected from Earth-8420. It will pair well with the hors d'oeuvre served with tonight's festivities.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Might I recommend the short glass with the fruit rind, Lady Harrow. It is a drink called a 'Pineapple Whiskey Smash'. It was very popular among the upper class on Earth-7482.&quot;</p>

<p>The conga-line makes its rounds, grabbing drinks from Aggy. Maximillian at no point halts his dancing, drinking as he goes. &quot;Ah~ You understand Us all too well. Never remiss, your expertise is second to none.&quot; He takes another sip. &quot;Delay Earth-8420's destruction by ten of its years.

<p>&quot;Your generosity will not go unnoticed among the population. I'm sure they will provide an even better vintage with the extra time permitted.&quot;</p>

<p>He seemed utterly unphased by her furious demeanor, almost talking to her in a condescending notion. Her scowl did not waver, forehead burrowed, casting a shadow over her brow that caused the glow of her eyes to appear brighter than before. The pause, the way he addressed her questions like that of a foolish child inquiring about something obvious, it felt almost passive aggressive. Or perhaps Harrow was just so inflamed that she wanted these facts to be true so she had a reason to bite back. Not that she needed said proof. Just by the way he smiled and jovially partied knowing <em>his</em> life was safe, <em>his</em> people were content, the universe rested in the palm of <em>his</em> hands just like all their lives - was reason enough to despise his existence.</p>
<p>Visions phased through her mind at rapid speeds, one's that clearly pained her expression to recall, but also devilishly delited her when she looked toward the blonde haired man.</p>
<p>If he could read minds, she wanted him to see these visions. She wanted him to <em>understand</em> that she <em>was a threat to him</em>, despite their power differences. But, if he couldn't, Harrow hoped that her expression at least conveyed the depths of her excruciating revulsion by his existence.</p>
<p>She just listened to him speak, watched as he continued dancing, and the purple apparition appeared before them both. It was an odd entity to say the least, though she recalled catching glimpses of it earlier. Seeing it truly up close and personal was like forcing her mind to wrap itself around something that…shouldn’t be understood. An eldritch quality was bound to it.</p>

<p>Harrow looked from Aggy to Max, unsure if the drinks were even <em>safe</em> to drink. Though, she knew that if Max truly did enjoy the sport of death games, poisoning one's captive would be one of the most uninteresting ways to watch their demise. So, Harrow nodded sharply to Aggy, taking the recommended drink, swirling it under her nose -wondering if drinking anything alcoholic would be smart in general- and took a sip. Surprisingly, she quite enjoyed it. Harrow could not recall the last time she had anything alcoholic. It was a hinderence and a distraction, one she couldnt afford. But in this instance, if these few days were to be her last, she would allow herself at least the comfort of a savory new experience before spending the coming days battling for the fate of her earth.</p>
<p>There was nothing else to say to max…well, nothing that would help her in any way. And yet, knowing this, she couldn’t stop the phrase “<em><strong>You make me sick</strong></em>” from whispering out of her trembling lips. Whether he heard it or not she didn’t know, nor did she think he wasn’t already aware of this. If anything, her disgust for him could potentially fuel the enjoyment he had in seeing them suffer. She took another long drink, swallowing numerous times, downing the rest in almost one gulp.</p>

<p>“So…Aggy, “ Harrow swished the remaining liquid and fruit around slowly, attempting to control a shaking hand, “from which decayed earth is his favorite vintage? Is it yours? Or perhaps -” she starts to laugh a frustrated, almost mad low chuckle - “perhaps you were given the position of eldritch bartender as a reward for saving your planet?” She chuckles harder, turning briefly sorrowful “Is…obliterating an entire planet and absorbing their beverages into his palate part of his pleasure? Or just a perk?...the last thing to remember the Earth by…are just a beverage…” she trails off…mourning whatever planet created the drink slithering down her throat, turning her stomach sour.</p>

<p>Aggy answers in the same deadpan monotone he has always kept, your words leaving him unphased.</p>
<p>&quot;Sire's current preferred drink of choice is what he has renamed to 'Honeyed Ambrosia', acquired from Earth-2438. However, our Philanthropic Liege also considers my recommendations for pairings based on his eclectic palette.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am from what has been designated Aglarian-8,978,321. Which has been archived as completely as I was able, and is the template with which I apply all other cataloguing efforts for any planet the Prosit visits. I assure you, more than just your beverages will be kept in our archives.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;hm...eclectic palette.&quot; She places her glass back on the creatures tray with a clang, fearing she might shatter it. Though the breaking of glass seemed to be a part of the festivities, Harrow had no wish to partake in any of it, much less one that would potentially damamge her skin. &quot;That he does.&quot;</p>
<p>Harrow wraps her arm's around herself, a heavy sigh heaving from her lips. As Aggy speaks, Harrow listens, though her brow raises quizically at some words.</p>
<p>&quot;<em>More than just our beverages,</em>&quot; a pondering pause, &quot;What exactly do you mean by that? If -that is- I am allowed to ask. I don't...want to get you into any kind of trouble.&quot; She eye's the blob in what she assumes are its eyes.</p>

<p>Aggy's 'gaze' does not falter, and the tray is merely placed inside his body for a moment, his face dissipating for 25 seconds as <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Mn4so2f.png">flashes of light are visible at random intervals within his formless cloud</a>. After 25 seconds the tray moves out of his cloud mass and the glass has been cleaned, and filled with the same drink you previously had.</p>
<p>As this process happens, Aggy's voice still speaks to you.</p>
<p>&quot;My duties within the Prosit are to provide refreshments for anyone who wishes to partake at 'Dive', the bar aboard this ship, as well as cataloguing everything I am able to about every planet the Prosit has visited for recordkeeping purposes. This includes your world. This also includes my world. And every world between them since I've been aboard this ship.&quot;</p>

<p>It was a long shot, but her eyes perked up when he -it- finished this sentance, a softer more curious glint in them. &quot;Your world? Your world being -i take it- one that survived because you too...won a death game?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Tell me Aggy, if you can, what was -is- your world like? Assuming it still exists, or doesn't exist. I'd like to hear about your home and...maybe even what you miss most about it?&quot; Harrow studies the cloud like entity with a contemplative look.</p>

<p>Aggy is silent for a moment before answering.</p>
<p>&quot;My homeworld was a lush temperate world, not dissimilar to Earth. Our climate was worsening. We were unable to find a solution to polution caused from combustion of various fuels used to operate our technology. The only solution we had left was to leave our biological forms behind, or be boiled alive by the full force of radiation from our star.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am the only one left of my kind. I did not win our event. I was granted time enough to catalogue my world before its destruction, and have continued to do so for every world we visit.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I...do not understand?&quot; Her eyes trail the room for a moment, landing on the still foolhardy figure of Max dancing around the room. Then, after a minute of thought, she turns back to Aggy.</p>
<p>&quot;Why did Max...what possessed him to give <em>your</em> earth this categorical mercy? Give you sanctuary? Why not just let you die off with your world? He seem's to enjoy watching that happen...unless of course your world particularly just had a damn good drink.&quot; The last part is said like a joke, but her tone stays stoic.</p>

<p>&quot;I believe there is something you might have misunderstood. My planet did not 'win'. I did not succeed in the competition. I survived, and I am able to disassemble anything I desire from the inside out. In fact, I did so to several others playing in the hope of killing anyone from Order in my game. I did not.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Further, consideration for whether a planet is 'doomed' or not is not taken into account. Of which, my people were not after our uploading. Only Sapience is considered.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see.&quot; Harrow nod's, processing the information and seeming to finally come to a conclusion she understands. Though the expression on her face twisted in a way that revealed a contempt in said conclusion, she didn't press the matter further.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I am sorry you had to experience that Aggy, even if it seems you are satisfied with the result of your life, I imagine going through that event wasn't easy for you or your kind.&quot; Things were getting heavy. Not so much for the cloud perhaps, but for Harrow, mentally, it definitely was. A change of subject was necessary.</p>
<p>&quot;So-&quot; she clears her throat,&quot;-about tonights 'rooms' that Max spoke of, not that I am in a position where you should trust me after how I spoke of your...friend, but, is there anything you are able to share which may benefit me in the coming days?&quot; She held its gaseous gaze with a serious stare.</p>

<p>Casually strolling up and down the grand halls of the ship, you see a lady wearing a bright red kimono with what appears to be a large mushroom cap on top of her head. She walks gracefully, with her hands clasped in front of her, twiddling her thumbs now and then as her head swivels to take in the surroundings. Every once in a while, she stops in front of a curious object or creature and takes a few moments to reflect, as if she were in some grand museum or central park.</p>

<p>Barbatos strides up, slowing down and spreading his hands in an attempt to seem none threatening. &quot;Good evening, and forgive me for interrupting your walk.&quot; He lowers his hands as he stops.</p>
<p>&quot;I...noticed that you have both bark and mushrooms growing off you. I've encountered many with scales and such...but no one with such a unique physique. Is it natural to have such plants growing on you? It looks...at least in my eyes...somewhat unhealthy.&quot;</p>

<p>Ami looks up at the large man before her and puts one hand up to her chest, in a little bit of shock. &quot;Haha, well you are one of the biggest animal-people I've ever seen! If I didn't know any better, I would've been startled.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As for the bark and fungi on me, they are natural, for me. Where I'm from, many people have plant-like appendages as a result of the Altering. I was born like this, but the fungi and bark have gradually spread over time. It does have some health detriments, but... it's to be expected for someone like me.&quot; She lowers her head a little and then continues in a more jovial tone, &quot;But enough about me. Since we don't come from the same world, I'm very curious to know what it's like where you're from.&quot;</p>

<p>Barbatos holds his chin, putting his other hand on his him and nodded. &quot;Altering...it sounds like you had a calamity happen to your world as well. My own world had it's own reckoning centuries ago, causing the weather and climate to go out of control...or so I've been told in stories. It all happened centuries before I was born.&quot;</p>
<p>Barbatos shrugs, looking up while thinking. &quot;As for specifics...anywhere to the north of the Paradise Belt is subzero, frozen tundra and forests. South of it is an arid, baked landscape that gets so hot it often felt like my fur was going to catch fire.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I suppose you could call it a Calamity,&quot; Ami replies. &quot;Basically, some scientists activated an alien device about thirty years ago, and it eventually lead to the entire Earth becoming altered. The flora and fauna rapidly evolved, the landscape and atmosphere completely changed, and people began to mutate in many strange ways.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Alien...but fairly recent. I would have been in my thirties or forties had it happened in my world. Our calamity was caused by the very same Magic Science that keeps many of the cities safe. Though...&quot;</p>
<p>Barbatos crosses his arms and looks back down at Ami. &quot;My world learned to manage it all despite the monsters and weather. Life goes on.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fire, Ice, Wind...Lightning...&quot; Barbatos scratches his head. &quot;It's odd now that I have to explain it. Most machines run on it, the barriers do as well. Personally, I have trouble with most types beyond physical boosting magic. Too much chanting and writing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Certainly,&quot; Ami chimes in. &quot;Many people have acquired strange powers that could be considered magical as a result of the mutations. Our infrastructure has modernized rapidly as a result and, with the emergence of animalfolk and plantfolk, we are able to preserve Earth's resources better than ever. It's just... a lot to get used to, I suppose.&quot;</p>

<p>Barbatos glances around, nodding briefly. &quot;Well, it has been good speaking with you. I must go find some kind of kitchen on this...ship?&quot; He scratches his head again, and then shrugs. &quot;I'll be fine if I follow my nose...I think.&quot;</p>
<p>Barbatos bows slightly, and then turns and walks off sniffing the air. &quot;Seriously...where is a kitchen...?&quot;</p>

<p>The unmistakable sound of a fisherman casting off his rod could be heard, and oddly enough there they were, amidst the ballroom doing exactly that. Hovantis had dropped anchor at the first body of water they found. A fanciful marble fountain lined with cherubs. One of the host’s more gaudy showpieces was now repurposed as a simple fishing hole. Which from the looks of its shallow waters, made for a poor sport of fishing, but perhaps this man just wanted to fish, catch be damned.</p>
<p>“Haaa….” The weary stranger sighed as they kicked up their feet.</p>
<p>The good life.</p>

<p>Ami giggles and takes Grug's hand to lead him in swaying with her. &quot;I suppose we have to tell each other what's on our notes at some point, don't we? I... am a little bit embarrassed to reveal my secret,&quot; she trails off and lowers her head slightly.</p>

<p>&quot;I... accidentally poisoned someone when I was a child,&quot; Ami says with a slight shake in her voice. &quot;It was when I was very young, around five years old. I was at school on the playground with my friend, Kiyomi, just building an imaginary city out of sand. At that time, I didn't have very many spores growing from me yet, and my face was not covered as it is now. My family didn't even know for sure what types of spores I had, but we didn't make a habit of plucking them and eating them or anything like that...&quot; Ami pauses a moment and focuses on the music before continuing. &quot;Well, long story short, Kiyomi was very curious about the spores growing from my back, and I was curious about the vines growing from her skin... they had such beautiful purple flowers on them back then... but anyway, not realizing the potential danger, I let her taste one of my spores and I picked one of her flowers to keep in my hair.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Kiyomi became very ill, and had to be hospitalized for a short time,&quot; Ami continued. &quot;Her vines permanently changed as well, darkening and becoming more thorny for self-defense, and her health never fully recovered... it was traumatic, and that's when I started being ashamed of what I am...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aaaaaah......&quot; Grug remains dancing, but sort of leans away from Ami. &quot;Now whatever Grug says will sound comparatively silly. And Ami is sure Grug will not die if he does not <em>eat</em> these 'spores'?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As long as you don't eat the red and white spores, you should be fine,&quot; Ami says, somewhat embarrassed. &quot;However, I mostly have that variety, so be careful if you ever do pick a spore from me.&quot;</p>

<p>Grug remains dancing, now even more clumsily, while simultaneously being stiff. &quot;Grug... will come out with it. Grug does not 'love' his wife. Sure, she is pretty, and Grug loves the children he has had with her, but he has no feelings for Morg. She is... too stupid. She cannot hold intellectual conversation with Grug. And it hurts Grug to feel this way.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Grug always had to keep the fire going, made sure it would never go out. Always putting new branches and brush on it, brought in by the people who went outside... would sometimes move the fire to clear the ash and coal away which covered the ground.&quot;</p>

<p>Classical music; deafening silence. Yumi looks at the man on the throne with compassion and understanding in her eyes. A tear held back. She strengthens her resolve and is the first to speak, calling out to him.</p>
<p>&quot;You're afraid, Max. Agony is tearing you apart from the inside; Its left a void you cannot fill. A building pressure, a feeling of indescribable weight. Sorrow. Guilt. I know the feeling all too well.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You sit above everyone atop your throne, the people surround you. Your power protects you? Nay, it isolates you. Poisoned by your own thoughts, you try to break free, you call for help, but nobody comes. <em>You are alone</em>. This game is nothing but a distraction from your sorrow.&quot;</p>
<p>Yumi graciously bows in <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1139564074984816722/1140688961958846637/L_g0194893524.png">her dress</a> and raises her hand towards him; A beckoning invitation to a dance. &quot;<em>Come</em>.

<p>Intrigued by the minor commotion caused, Ami stands them and cocks her head to the side, in an intrigued manner. If anyone were to look directly at her in that moment, they could see a pair of bright red lips turn up in a slight smirk, and an insect-like black eye with one eyebrow raised.</p>

<p>Maximillian leans an elbow on the arm of his throne. Bringing his hand to his chin, he looks down inquisitively as Yumi hurls accusation after accusation. A sudden look of pain or disappointment sweeps over the man's face before being replaced with a smile. As he is about to reply Hovantis interjects. His eyes gently drift over to the man, settling on him for many seconds. Answering presumably to both, he ponders aloud, &quot;Why, indeed. Truly the final frontier, one beyond even Us. <em>Why.</em>&quot; The man's focus falls directly onto Yumi again. &quot;Quite presumptuous, champion. It is Our charge that we not forget and it is a cherished burden at that. Our record is but the first step among many to understanding.&quot; His eyes briefly shift to Hovantis and then back to Yumi. &quot;In Our conquest we have seized more than just the multiverse. We have seized the very notion of <em>what</em> and <em>how</em> from God himself. What eludes us remains hidden yet. <em>Why</em>.&quot;</p>
<p>His smile wanes notably. &quot;Though, your assessment of Us is not wholly incorrect. In Our pursuit to fathom the stoic orders we have become something of their shadow.&quot;</p>

<p>“A shadow can only be led, it will never lead. A suitable dance partner They are not.”</p>

<p>Hovantis smiles kindly “I would certainly hope not, Oujo-san.These old bones might be long trekked, but it has been quite some time since I last had to remember the steps. I don’t suspect you’ll get much mileage out of this worn down oji-san. Forgive me.” Hovantis leads the lady to the center of the hall, and slowly but surely the fisherman manages to successfully lead her into a classic waltz. His movements are stilted at times but they do indeed appear to be dancing.</p>
<p>“You look stunning. I am happy that so far I have at least avoided embarrassing ourselves.” he smiles to both the lady and at himself. “I must admit… I have not actually opened my letter yet. This is all a bit baffling. Cherished burdens. To not forget. Understanding. I feel as if von Blitz is directly calling me out. The nature of their words both veiled and direct. Perhaps intentionally so to be a flowered canvas for the unsuspecting humanities like ourselves to project onto.” Hovantis’ kind smile dampens as he ponders.</p>
<p>Focusing back on Yumi they resolve “Excuse the pitiful face. I do believe we are too far to get cold feet now.” The fisherman strides through their steps and the speed of their waltz picks up to a respectable pace.</p>

<p>“This is one of those instances where it might not be appropriate to say ladies first. Seen as I’m the lead, it's only right I break the ice.”</p>
<p>“The letter.” Hovants gestures to it in his breast pocket, laid directly over his heart. “If you share with me what yours says, then I shall trust you to read mine.”</p>
<p>“I’ve walked many worlds on my barren “Earth”. Hovantis looks Yumi in the eye with a thousand yard stare. “For fifty-thousand years. I believe this Oji-san is bound to forget a thing or two.”</p>
<p>“If I am to propose a guess as to what the contents of that letter entails…. I would assume it is in regards to Yoshinari. A name I have not uttered in a very long time. After the star rail imploded, I wandered through a vast array of different dimensions in search for my missing colleagues. We were all prepared for the unfathomable, but some I harbored more concern for than others, knowing they were of meager constitution. Yoshinari-san was one of those colleagues.”</p>
<p>“What I refer to in my log as Beyond the Star Rail, is a series of infinitely spawning pocket dimensions that we theorized and brought into actuality. Shattering reality as we knew it in the process. My first plan of action after the fact was to search for those of my team that were MIA. Adrift, for that long… I had only encountered five of them in all my travels. All but one, if not fully, then at least halfway or more, no longer resembled anything bearing humanity. They had been warped into entities and became a permanent part of whatever worlds they found themselves in.” Hovantis couldn’t help but look over at the ghost-like apparitions of the fading socialites around them after hearing his own words.</p>

<p>“Yoshinari-san. He was the only one that still resembled himself. At least physically.” “I had found myself in a world comprised entirely of one small strip of an island amongst a vastly infinitely blue ocean. To my shock. Yoshinari-san was there. However, there were no rocks lined upon the sand marking an sos, or even any attempt at surviving or finding the keys to exit that world. Time did not pass normally there, as was the case in the vast array of worlds beyond the star rail. You could never age or grow hungry. And it appeared diving underwater there simply popped one back up onto the beach dry as paper like never anything happened. I do not know how long Yoshinari-san had been there before my arrival… but I regret not coming sooner. Despite my best attempts, it seemed I was unable to rouse any boon in their morale either.”</p>
<p>“They had given up.”</p>
<p>The pair take a pause in their steps before pivoting once more to the music.</p>
<p>“They had given up. Eventually. I was forced to accept that fact. I could not save them. No. Perhaps they did not need to be saved. That’s what I tried to assure myself.” Hovantis nods. “Having already long since discovered the key of that world, I left them my best fishing rod and some tools to rebuild should they ever lift themselves from that endless wallowing.”</p>
<p>“<em>That faded over, hopeless look in their eyes when I made parting.</em> That I would guess is likely what the contents of my letter entails.” The fisherman admits regrettably.</p>
<p>“Ah, but perhaps this windbag has gone on far too long already. If you will share with me your letter, then it shall be an honor.”</p>
<p>The lead was Yumi’s to take.</p>

<p>Accepting the lead, she stumbles at first. This part of the dance not duly practiced.</p>
<p>&quot;Yoshinari... A fate worse than death. Sorry that you lost a friend to the tortuous endeavor against time.&quot;</p>
<p>She begins to recount some moment of her past. &quot;We had returned just 2 days ago. Everyone was exhausted with an urgent request from the president of the Chi Association came in. Even as the director, I cannot turn it down.&quot;</p>
<p><em>&quot;Determine the cause of the disappearance of East Section 5. You leave at 0600&quot;</em></p>
<p>&quot;At a moments notice I gathered my 25 pioneers, battered and weakened, to venture out into the corruption once more. This time, into a unfamiliar land.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Two weeks out, we found remnants of their equipment in a forest valley. We were tired, and happy to finally find a clue for our mission. I should have known better. I should have been more through and careful.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was an ambush. 7 monsters, individually weak but together they were strong. <em>Very</em> strong. That many corrupted monsters working together is completely unheard of; there have been rare cases of 2, maybe 3, but nowhere near seven. With their high ground advantage, and the surprise of the ambush, we were no match. They had no weaknesses and we'd fallen for their trap.&quot;</p>
<p>Yumi's face draws a blank, looking out over Hovantis' shoulder. Doing the motions of the dance, as if without feeling. &quot;23 died so that we could escape. The 7 monsters all lived on. It was my fault they'd lost their lives, yet they gave it willingly so that we may go on. 23 families lost someone that day...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;When we returned, I quit. I swore never to venture out again. Of course, I broke that promise because it pained me to see new recruits go out never to return. If I were to forget the day of loss, I'd make the same mistake again. In the pain and the sorrow, I force myself to remember.&quot;</p>
<p>Her attention turns back to Hovantis. His letter. She stops the dance and gently pulls his letter out of his breast pocket.</p>

<p>She reads the letter silently and returns it to his shirt. Looking at Hovantis with apologetic eyes. &quot;You had a child, I'm sorry.&quot; She takes his hands once again and begins to lead the dance once more. After a moment of silence she carefully recites the letter as it had been written.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;*The dream that always persists.</p>
<p>A memory knowingly forgotten.</p>
<p>From one end of the city of Tokyo to the other.</p>
<p>In the passenger seat sat your daughter.*&quot;</p>

<p>After much trepidation and tip-toeing and tenacity, Mabel finally approaches Maximillian.</p>
<p>&quot;Um... mister... I, um... just to ask...&quot;</p>
<p>She clears her throat, and blurts out &quot;We really need to dance with someone and share our secret here even if it's really embarrassing?&quot;</p>
<p>But after getting that out, she already whimpers back and away from the man.</p>

<p>&quot;Earning Our favor is not tied to your survival. If fear assails you We will not hold you in lesser regard.&quot; His voice is matter of fact. A casual gaze remains fixed on Mabel, perhaps uncomfortably so, while he stares in silence.</p>

<p>“Oh bother! Can't you tell you’re frightening the poor girl? At least <em>try</em> to be somewhat tactful!” Archibald walks in to scathingly scold the golden man. Then he pulls Mabel away from Max to avoid his imposing and creepy gaze.</p>
<p>Noticing Mabel’s scared disposition, the Count holds out his hand to Mabel. “Don’t worry about that fop, young lady. There’s no need to spill secrets you are not comfortable with. However, I can teach you how to dance if you’re interested. As they say, when in Rome, do as the Romans do.” He chuckles gently.</p>

<p>&quot;I... don't know how to dance, Archie... Oh I hope I don't embarrass myself at a fancy fairytale ball,&quot; as Mabel blushes with both hands on her cheeks.</p>

<p>“Splendid! Fear not, lady Mabel. The only embarrassing thing here is the conduct of our host. Just take it slow, don’t look at your feet, and trust my lead. Do all that, and you’ll be the queen of the ballroom.” Assures the Count with a graceful bow.</p>
<p>He pulls Mabel in slightly closer to assume a waltzing position. As the music plays, Archibald carefully guides the girl as they dance to the pace of the music.</p>

<p>As the two glide across the room, Archibald leads Mabel with one hand held high and another on her lower back. He nods and gives cues for her to turn and shift directions. “Quite well done for your first dance, young lady.”</p>
<p>As they continue Archie starts to look somewhat woebegone. “This reminds me while I was still part of the Midas Club. They had an annual ball every year, and I’d take my wife Gwendolyn there as my dance partner. However, I was soon expelled from the Club due to petty disagreements, and a year later my wife pssed away from an unknown illness. No one offered me any help, and I saw the rich for who they truly were. That’s when I swore to fight for the common people, and tear down the bureaucratic aristocracy through uprisings and sharing knowledge. So that’s a something I don’t like talking about, Mabel. Back home… I have a lot of enemies.” He slowed down a bit while explaining, but after finishing he resumes his pace while giving a little twirl to Mabel.</p>

<p>Her foot catches a few times, but Mabel manages to stay proper. &quot;I'm so sorry, Archie... That must have been heartwrenching, losing the people you thought were friends, and... the love of your life, too...&quot;</p>
<p>But as Archibald picks up the pace again, she contemplates her next thoughts in silence.</p>
<p>&quot;Archie... my parents haven't been much presence in my life. They've been out at their company all day and night, working themselves to the bone... and it's not even for anything. Just to... keep up appearances of being rich I suppose. Even when the façade has fallen and surely no one else even notices, they're still throwing themselves into work, and my empty days were filled with just a hollow mansion, imagining a gorgeous ball like this...&quot;</p>
<p>At this point the strength loosens in Mabel's grip as she continues &quot;Um... what I want to say is, I'm so sorry your future was robbed from you. You and your lovely wife... had such a fairy-tale story ahead... tragedies in my books would always make me cry, but for a friend to experience it, that's too much...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I really would've loved to see that happiness in your life, Archie.&quot; Mabel gives a smile and averts her gaze in embarrassment.</p>

<p>Archibald gives the girl a look of pity, briefly halting their dance. “How sad. Parents neglecting their children always bothered me so much. I hope Cynthia doesn’t feel similarly went I enrolled her in a school in India for her safety. Maybe… once I see her again, I will apologize for not asking what she truly wanted.”</p>
<p>He gives Mabel an affectionate embrace. “Don’t worry Mabel. Your a source of happiness for me too, and once we are free of this, I’ll ensure your own happiness as well.”</p>

<p>Mabel gulps. &quot;Yes... but please... treasure your own happiness too Archie. Stay safe. Can we promise that to each other? With... a pinky-promise?&quot;</p>

<p>Henry walks up to the dance floor, taking Julianna's hands in his, and leads the dance. He spins Julianna around, gently, before once again swaying to the music. He's a good dancer, he must have practice from somewhere.
&quot;I must say, it's nice dancing again. I haven't done it in a while, especially with such enjoyable company.&quot; He smiles and gives his signature wink.

<p>&quot;Best to get it over with early dear. I find holding onto regrets only makes things worse as you get older. A problem shared is a problem halved, after all. Even... no, especially if it's with a stranger.&quot;</p>
<p>Juliana sighs and steels herself.
&quot;My letter is... from my daughter. Well... well I mean it isn't, but it's the same as a letter I got from her long ago. Yes, I can remember the wording being the exact same, like it was pulled directly from my mind.&quot;</p>
<p>She sniffs, takes a breath, and wipes her glasses.
&quot;And it said... it said she hated me. That I was never there for her because I was always staying late at work, and that I was too old-fashioned, stuck-up and selfish to listen to what she wanted. And that she... <em>sniff</em> never wanted to see me again, and was going off to live a better life in the city!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And the worst part, was that I really did never see her again after that. And then I found out I never would.&quot;</p>
<p>She stops to regains her composure.
&quot;Rather funny, isn't it? Little cozy old me living so long, and being sent out here, out of everyone I knew who could have handled it so much better. But, well, that's just how things go... I suppose.&quot;</p>

<p>Henry frowns, and squeezes Juliana's shoulder. &quot;I'm sure you did your best. Sometimes people don't appreciate all you do for them.&quot; His face darkens. &quot;It must be tough.&quot;
And then, as if it had never been there, Henry's frown disappears, and the cheshire grin he's worn for most of his time on the station takes its place.</p>
<p>&quot;I guess it's my turn now huh?&quot;
His grin somehow widens even more, and his eyes glint in the light. He hums to the music for a bit, before leaning closer to Juliana. The music dips as he speaks.
&quot;I'm a murderer.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good gracious, are you really?&quot;
She leans away and takes a step back from the grinning man, eyeing him up as well as she's able. She pauses, slowly shifts her head, and then...</p>
<p>...bursts out laughing.
&quot;Ohohoho! I nearly forgot! You're the jester, aren't you. I must say, you put on a good act. A little risqué, but you've certainly shocked all the regret right out of my system. Such a comedian, I guess you really <em>killed it</em> with that one! Hahaha!&quot;</p>

<p>Holding a champagne glass that’s half full (or half empty, in Henry’s eyes), Henry saunters over to a less densely populated area of the common room. He sets the champagne glass on the floor and takes a few steps back, pulling out his golf club. He draws it back and takes a swing at the glass, shattering it into an impressive spray of detritus and champagne.</p>
<p>Henry turns back to anyone that happens to be watching his bizarre ploy for attention and grins. He holds out his arms, addressing the crowd.</p>
<p>“Everyone! It has come to my attention that I am not particularly popular around these parts!” Henry laughs, as if the thought of being unlikeable was ridiculous.</p>
<p>“That is why I have decided to come clean to all of you. I am the jester! And I have no horse in this race. I do not care about who the champion is nor do I wish to know. Any future engagement I find myself in I will ensure is non-lethal to both parties!” Henry’s face splits open in a massive grin.</p>

<p>Whatever experience Archibald endured must’ve been quite exhausting.

<p>One would notice that the gentleman’s outfit differed from before. It’s just as fanciful, but it’s more modern and colored magenta. He’d fit perfectly at a typical nightclub barring the top hat which still donned his head.</p>

<p>Z approaches Archibald slowly, seemingly distracted at first as you can see the threads of his suit tightening. A dark purplish hue to the whole outfit, the velvety threads seem to struggle as a sudden ripping is heard and several tentacles burst out of the back of it snaking and slithering idly as Z gives a sigh of relief</p>
<p>&quot;Never did like wearing anything other than my robes. In any case, stranger, you look like you could use a pick me up&quot;</p>
<p>Z's tentacles slink back into his suit, emerging with an electric kettle a clean cup, and a brown wooden box, a tentacle opening it to reveal packets of instant coffee as well as a small selection of tea</p>

<p>Still sluggish, the Count slowly raises his head to look at the tentacled man offering a kind gesture. Seems like the simple look is enough to get Archibald animated. He immediately sits up straight, caught off guard by Z’s sudden appearance. “O-O-Oh. C-Cheerio chap. Z, is it? Don’t believe we spoken before. I appreciate the offer, but I usually prefer-”</p>
<p><em>Ssssssssssss!</em></p>
<p>Cedric emerges from Archibald’s sleeve, looking very alarmed at the unknown figure. Even the ferret looked different. This time he was wearing a tiny, dapper hat. How on earth did someone find one so small?</p>

<p>Z Jumps a bit at the sudden appearance of the furry rodent, thought fortunately his tentacles stay still, suspended in air as he laughs catching his breath before grabbing a cup of coffee and filling it for himself</p>
<p>&quot;Quite the cute little friend you've got there. And a snazzy dresser to. I assume your little night of exploration left you just as tired as it did me&quot; Z said with a sigh drinking deeply from his cup</p>

<p>“My apologies. Normally he behaves himself. It’s so unlike him to act aggressively to strangers. As I was saying, I usually prefer bubble tea over the ordinary beverage. I take it you’re a caffeine aficionado? It sure works wonders for the weary.”</p>
<p>He notices Ami and Victoria join the gathering, offering a friendly wave to both. “Pleased to see you again, Miss Ami! And you must be Lady Victoria. A woman of few words. You’re both welcome to listen in.” After a long stretch, he sits up straight and rests his arms behind his head.</p>
<p>“So, I take we all had a psychedelic experience of our own?”</p>

<p>Archibald responds to Ami first. “This is Cedric, my companion animal. He’s very shy and prefers to stay hidden, but seemed a little hostile to Z… which is out of character for him. Maybe he’s not used to tentacles.” He shakes his head and gives an apologetic look to Z.</p>
<p>Then he addresses the mysterious Victoria, seemingly surprised she’d even bother to ask. “I’m from United Kingdom, specifically Gloucester. However, I have a holiday home in the United British Principalities of America that stay in on occasion. It’s located in New Liverpool, Texas. Fabulous place to get some good sunlight!”</p>

<p>“Ah, Mr. Grug, I’d be happy to unbutton your shirt for you. Much more civilized than simply ripping them off.

<p>“Ah. So you’re a kindler! A master of the campire. Say, Mr. Grug, I don’t think marshmallows exist in your time. Its a tradition to roast some over an open fire while camping. I did this with Cynthia once or twice. Want to find some?” Archibald points to a place located near Aggy’s area where food might be found. Coincidentally near the sofa, a fireplace is flickering mildly.</p>
<p>“I can’t have you taste my castoreum cologne. It might smell nice, but I assure you it’ll be very yucky in your mouth. Marshmallows have a similar smell however, and they taste great! Do you like sweet things? I’m sure you at least has berries before.”</p>

<p>&quot;No, Grug has never heard of these 'marsh-mallows.' Roast them? Like meat? Hm. Perhaps Grug could... look for some. Many people have given Grug very good food here. Still...&quot; He looks at the fireplace and visibly cringes for a moment before returning to normal. &quot;Who is this 'Cynthia'?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Grug and his tribe have berries, when they can be found are ripe. Grug's favorite are the blackberries, though they are a pain to pick.&quot;</p>

<p>“Cynthia is my daughter. I heard through the grapevine you have a family of your own, Mr. Grug.” Archibald peruses the nearby area to search for marshmallows. Eventually he spots some and some wooden skewers to boot. The Count hands one to Grug with a marshmallow topped on it. Then he seats himself near the fireplace to demonstrate.</p>
<p>“Blackberries eh? My late wife enjoyed those immensely. Personally, my favorites are blueberries! They are the most versatile fruit, and they pair excellently with my granola!” Thanks to the Count’s meticulous technique, the marshmallow on Archie’s stick turns a perfect gold. He allows the curious caveman to try it. “Here, try it.” Offers Archibald. “I think you’ll enjoy it. If you do, you try roasting your own marshmallow!”</p>

<p>&quot;Grug has two children as well.&quot; Grug nods. &quot;Son is Peat, and his daughter is Liza. Grug understands why you must try to survive, then.&quot; He nods.</p>
<p>Though Grug looks at the fireplace with disdain, the marshmallow immediately catches his attention and he stares at it as Archibald roasts it. &quot;Blueberries... are not bad. Grug is sorry to hear about your wife.&quot;</p>
<p>As Archibald finishes roasting his marshmallow, Grug takes the stick from him, and takes a nervous bite. &quot;SUWEET,&quot; Grug initially spits out his first nibble into the fireplace, but before Archibald can take the stick from him, he holds up a hand. He then opens his mouth, and sticks his tongue out, resting the hot marshmallow on it. Suddenly, he stuffs it into his mouth and finishes it off. &quot;Mmmm. Not bad. Maybe good as a special treat.

<p>Grug’s initial reaction seems to disappoint Archie, clicking his teeth after the apparent revulsion displayed. Once Grug once warms up to the marshmallow the Count nods with a pleased smile. “You had me worried there, Mr. Grug, but it seems like marshmallows are a hit with you after all!”</p>
<p>Noticing Grug seemed to dislike potentially interacting with the fire, Archibald takes the hint. “If you want, I can continue roasting the marshmallows for you. You don’t have to try it yourself if you don’t wish to.”</p>

<p>The sight of the woeful Grug called the woman’s attention. Usually, the man was so chipper, a lively step to his primordial walk and conversation. However now, not only was there a haunting look in his eye that she recognized, but a grim tone to his voice which concerned Harrow.</p>
<p>She came up behind him, heels clicking across the floor, a tender tone of concern in her word’s.</p>
<p>“Hey Grug -Grug the Genius-” A scorched hand makes its way to Grug’s shoulder, alerting him to Harrow’s presence, “Are you okay? What…what did you see?!”</p>

<p>“So it appears a life is lost already…” Archibald joins the two upset mutuals. In his hand is a glass of bubble tea, pink and full of juicy pearls. He too appears sorrowful.</p>
<p>“Grug and Harrow, I haven’t talked to either of you before, but I can tell this loss is extremely troubling to both you. I lost my wife as I sat down next her hospital bed. Learning about death is one thing, but witnessing it leaves a scar in one’s heart like no other. Take all the time you need mourn him.”</p>

<p>&quot;Grug saw it... a huge and shining and loud beast stampeded forth from a hole in the wall, and the man was trampled to nothing in an instant. He... did not dodge. He could not dodge. Perhaps Grug's determination earlier that day broke the man's will to continue on, knowing he might have to face Grug.&quot; Grug looks pensive.</p>

<p>&quot;He's right, Grug. Feeling helpless in a circumstance like this is a heavy weight to bear, and seeing someone pass should never be an easy thing to witness. I am sorry this happened to you...&quot;</p>
<p>Her hand squeezes his shoulder.</p>
<p>&quot;Is there anything else you can tell us about what you saw? What exactly this ‘beast’ was, where it came from perhaps? Or...if there is anything we can do to help you here and now?&quot; Harrow glances at Archibald, hoping to meet his gaze of agreement in her request for comfort. As she does this, she directs a “I am sorry to hear about your wife,” in his direction.</p>

<p>&quot;Grug had never seen anything like it before. He does not know how to describe it better than he has! Tall, long, shiny, loud, it came out of a hole and left through a hole! It was so fast!&quot; He pauses.</p>
<p>&quot;Grug remembers a saying from home. <em>'The gods do not smash ground because ground is bad. They do it because ground can’t dodge.'</em> The man could not dodge....&quot;</p>

Ignoring Maximillian and his music, he takes a seat in the far corner of the hall and downs his glass.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing matters...&quot; the man grumbles to himself, reaching into his back pant pocket to retrieve the cellphone. He rests himself atop the cold, hard surface as he peers into the screen. &quot;Nothing else matters...&quot;</p>
<p>With a few flicks, the classical music in Benjamin's little corner becomes drowned out by something <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAWphDD1_38">a little different</a>.</p>

<p>Ami begins swaying slightly to the music, filled with a sudden little jolt of determination. &quot;Well, I certainly appreciate her sound! It's very motivating.&quot;</p>

<p>Noticing Ben's downcast expression, she adds, &quot;I take it the night was rough for you too, then?&quot;</p>

<p>Benjamin briefly sits there nodding along, though who knows whether it's in agreement or jammin' to his music.</p>
<p>&quot;Well...&quot; he mentions, breaking the silence. &quot;Night was... not the greatest, though I suspect for reasons other than what some ran into. Plans apparently fell through and I was alone the whole night.&quot; His slightly sour expression brightens with a snort. &quot;Heh, not that I'm <em>unfamiliar</em> with that experience.&quot;</p>
<p>The man raises the phone up high, the bright screen facing towards the rest of the room. &quot;But that doesn't matter. What matters is Pomu. Glad at least some people here can appreciate her.&quot;</p>
<p>He slowly leans in. &quot;I know it would be a big ask, but if either of you win it big here, I don't suppose you'd be willing to tack on a little <em>and also save Pomu Rainpuff from Benjamin Trout's Earth</em> with your big request. Should be no issue at all for this 'Architect'.&quot;</p>

<p>Ami walks down the hall a little slowly, scuffling along in her wooden sandals. You notice she's dressed a little differently now, in a fashionable red pantsuit, a white puffy blouse, and shiny white gloves. Her head is held down a bit as she walks toward the dancefloor, and she stands on the outskirts of the party to watch as the scene unfolds. &quot;That was quite the night...&quot; she mumbles to herself as she crosses her arms in front of her. &quot;Quite the night, indeed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I just couldn't let you go after seeing you Ami. I just needed to tell you how well the white and red aesthetic coloring match you. You've got truly wonderful taste.&quot; A genuine compliment.</p>

<p>Barbatos appears to be both mystified and slightly annoyed as he stands at the edge of the party, now dressed in a chef's uniform with gray slacks, a white shirt, and a white chef hat atop his head. His roaring muscles contained by the clothing, he seems to be moving somewhat slowly as if to not rip his new threads. He crosses his arms and shakes his head. &quot;I'd rather not do that again...ever.&quot;</p>

<p>Archibald sees the beast man with his amusingly unfitting clothes, walking over to comment. “That’s quite the change in attire, Mr. Dragonoff. Have you taken up culinary expertise? I sure hope we humans are not on the menu.” He jests with a smile.</p>
<p>“Funny though, since assuming you were the one doing the cooking, I was the one during the eating! And blimey that food was <em>mediocre</em>! I know for a fact you weren’t the cook though, so I’m not accusing you for the meal.”</p>

<p>Barbatos turns to the man and grunts, obviously still slightly annoyed from the situation. &quot;While I've hunted and cooked many exotic beasts, I've never had the notion to cook humans. Or any similar race.&quot;</p>
<p>He attempts to roll his shoulders a little, finding that he can move slightly more than he thought he could but stops short of doing a full rotation. &quot;And I've been a chef for decades. I learned early on the only way for me to keep up my large physique was to make and balance most of my meals myself, and my employers took advantage of those skills.&quot;</p>

<p>Archibald readjusts his hat while listening. “Impressive! So you really are a seasoned gourmet! I wager your expertise revolves around roasts and stews. Unless your diet isn’t strictly carnivorous.”</p>
<p>The gentleman notices Barbatos struggling in his new outfit. “Do you want assistance removing these restricting clothes?” He offers. “I helped Grug earlier with his own struggles. Seems these fancy garments aren’t for everyone.”</p>

<p>Barbatos shakes his head, testing his grip and flexing a bit, the fabric managing to stay together on his arms. &quot;This is...fine for the moment. I can make do.&quot;</p>
<p>He then crosses his arms. &quot;Roasts and stews are good, hearty meals that I do make quite often. However, while I do eat a lot of protein, I'm quite experienced in balanced and vegetarian dishes as well. You see, while I was in the service of a nobleman, I was not only his personal guard, but also his personal chef. I cooked for him, his family, and his guests quite often...until I left his service of course.&quot;</p>

<p>Barbatos narrows his eyes, appearing in deep thought for a moment. &quot;It'd have to be honey braised lamb shanks, paired with gratin stuffed portabello mushrooms. I often served it with a mix of roasted carrots and cauliflower, as well as mead I brewed myself.&quot;</p>

<p>He looks down to the side, and then nods. &quot;Well, for starters this was an ice dragon. They don't breathe fire, and are considerably smaller...but a dragon is well...a dragon. That was actually the second ice dragon I've dealt with. The first one almost killed me, and thirty...&quot;</p>
<p>Barbatos stops and starts counting fingers. &quot;Thirty-three...no. Thirty-four years after that I was hired to hunt the second. Instead of fighting it head on like before, I dropped barrels of gunpowder onto it from above. Kind of cowardly, but it got the job done.&quot;</p>

<p>Barbatos doesn't move, instead standing still and crossing his arms. &quot;I was alone both times. The first time I went alone because I was foolish and headstrong. The second because nobody else wanted to fight the dragon.&quot;</p>
<p>He sighs, shaking his head. &quot;Hell, neither did I...but I was being paid good coin to at least drive it off. I just decided to use explosives hoping that having its nest exploded would force it to leave. I honestly wasn't expecting that would finish it off.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Seems like things went badly for everyone,&quot; Victoria remarks, suddenly standing next to Barbatos. She looks him up and down.
&quot;Was your room cooking-themed?&quot;</p>

<p>Barbatos turns to her, taking off his chef hat and looking at it with a grunt. &quot;It certainly wasn't pleasant. Actually more of a nightmare really. But...&quot;</p>
<p>He puts the hat back on. &quot;It does...surprisingly fit the situation, at least for me. I am experienced as a cook.&quot;</p>

<p>Swaying on her feet as if blown by a stray wind, Mabel stands with an absent-minded expression. She's no longer in a suit; instead, she wears a flowing black dress, modest yet beautiful.</p>
<p>Gradually, realization crosses her face as she glances around the room. &quot;Um, a dance? Like a... fancy ball?&quot; She takes a step, stops, and uncertainly tries piecing together what to do next.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, um... on another note, do you think this party here goes on forever? We've only been here a short while, but all the people celebrating never comes close to stopping. I wonder what kind of festivity lasts for so long... it seems like a happy one.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes... but time's running out. I'm... not sure how things will go for the rest of this contest, because with what happened last night with... that one man...&quot; Mabel gulps, &quot;means we might all face that future for ourselves.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And even worse... it will be at our own hands. I've been trying not to think about what will happen in just a few short hours, an enjoy the atmosphere here for the first time in my life... but...&quot;</p>

For a brief minute she break down in tears before pulling her self together and looking to the crowd. &quot;Hello! Anyone that can help me get back to my daughter, I-I'll do anything. My body yours to do anything with! All free of charge. I just need to survive this and get back to my daughter! I swear! I'll do anything, and anyone could do anything they want to with me!&quot; Her face full of tears and blubbering as she finished what she was saying.</p>

<p>Looking at the note she takes a moment to calm down before smiling at the note. &quot;She's only 14 and full of life. She didn't have the upbringing that I had. But I've given her the best life I can. She's beautiful and friendly. She made the most of what she had when we could barely eat at night.

<p>In truth, Harrow doesn’t know where to touch the item - woman - female furniture piece. Instinctively, finding herself close to the blubbering woman in passing, her hand extends, planning to place itself on a trembling shoulder, only to find itself with no such place to land. It hovers there for a moment.</p>
<p>“Uhm…hey, ma’am, are you -” a hard pause, “-is everything o-” her eyes roll at her own question with an obvious answer. With a sigh, Harrow leans down to face the chair, her arm retracting itself toward her chest.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if offering yourself up like that is the best way to get home to your daughter. Someone might…take you up on that, and ensure you don’t.” There is a caring gentleness to her eyes.</p>
<p>“I’m not much for parties myself, but…if talking about what’s going on will get you in the right headspace for things to come, and the party, well, I'm a great listener,” she smiles.</p>

<p>In tears Janeet looks back to Harrow while still sniffling tears as she begins to calm down. She then softly begins to talk &quot;Thank you ah... I don't actually know your name. Oh and my name is Janeet.&quot;
Another sniffly tear and a deep sigh she continues. &quot;It all started with Chairster taking me as his wife. All his claims to protect me and my daughter, to give us a better life were all a lie! He is not protecting us, we should be protected from him. Constantly beating me down and controlling me with the threat of  hurting my daughter.&quot;</p>
<p>Wipping her tears away with her right arm she sniffles again. &quot;Now I'm here; having escaped from him after all this time. But have I truly escaped? I'm god knows where and I don't know what is going to happen to my daughter.&quot;</p>

<p>A heartfelt hand rises to Harrow's chest, a sincere gesture of care at Janeet's story. &quot;Janeet...I'm so sorry,&quot; she bends her knees and sits on them, level with Janeet's face. Harrow places a gentle blackened left hand on the tip of the chair's arms. &quot;I’m Harrow, it's nice to meet you...I've never met a sentient chair before - well, not one that wasn't controlled by an AI companion,&quot; she chuckles softly.</p>
<p>&quot;Cruel fate after cruel fate,&quot; she continues with a swallow, thinking on her words, &quot; It seems you are another soul I've come across that has more than enough reason to win all this, just to have a chance at freedom with your daughter.&quot;</p>
<p>A sigh heaves Harrow's shoulders up, and then down, her grip on Janeet's arm tightening. &quot;Janeet, listen to me. This might be easy for me to say, being used to my own experiences and all, but you can't think like this, with sadness and woe. If you want any chance -<em>any</em>- chance of seeing your daughter again and living the life you and her <em>deserve</em> then you have to find a will to fight. Ignore the sorrow, the depression, the questions you are cursed with, <em>burry them</em>, and <em>use</em> your daughter as your fire. Here-&quot; she gives Janeet's arm a friendly pat, &quot;-why don't you tell me about her? Just...talk, hear yourself talk, remind yourself who she is and why she is worth fighting for, I want to listen. Past this night there may not be much I can do to help you. But right here, right now, I want to be of some help to you in what ways I can.&quot;</p>

<h1>&quot;WHOOOOO!! YEAH! I CAN'T BELEIVE THESE REALLY EXIST!!! BEACHES. ARE. AWESOME!!!!&quot;</h1>
<p>The source of this sound is a girl screaming with excitement. She wears flowing red hair and a modest white swimsuit. Her arms shoot in the air as she twirls with great enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Hurried footprints lead from where you stand towards the edge of the water. Along the trail, several items have been dropped and left unattended. First, an umbrella :beach_umbrella:  lay closed and half burred. A few steps later, seemingly flung far too the right, a beach bag sitting in it's own crater. A towel crumpled on the floor. Finally, just out of reach of the constant waves, a half buried radio hooked up to an MP3 player. Its blaring a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNE9oa3pTIc&amp;list=PLRhBbYE3LVg4ZQajIF_4JThxKF2URQBDs&amp;index=1">strange playlist</a>. Mostly some sort of rock. The girl in the distance seems to dive into the water as a wave crashes into her. Not even a moment, she reemerges.</p>
<p>||# &quot;ARRGH MY EYES!&quot;
As she screeches, her hands cover her eyes as if if that that was going to help. After a moment of rapid blinking, she can be observed cupping water in her hands, bringing some to her mouth. &quot;<strong>Saltwater!?!??!</strong> Bullshit! Who's bright idea was this?&quot; Like some sort of crazy lunatic, she talks to herself. She points at the water as if she were to accuse it of some great crime. &quot;Some damn salt won't stop me from seeing what I wish to!&quot; She dives back into the water. ||</p>
<p>||# &quot;OH GOD THE BURN IS WORSE THE 2ND TIME&quot;
Seemingly on instinct, she bends down to clear her eyes, splashing more water into them. ||</p>
<p>||# &quot;AARGH&quot;
She lets out a sharp yelp and takes a moment to recover and reflect. Eventually, her arms cross as she gazes out into the ocean pouting. &quot;You win this time Beach. Next time will be a different story, kay?&quot;||</p>

<p>Seseri walks over to the side of the beach and looks out into the distance. Taking off her mask and settling it down gently next to Yumi, she wades out into the water, getting about ankle-deep before sitting down, her head resting on her knees, staring off into the horizon. She looks to be deep in thought.
Left next to Yumi is a note reading <em>&quot;I've never seen a beach so... clear. Unpolluted.&quot;</em></p>

<p>In agreement with a soft smile, &quot;I know... it's beautiful.&quot; She breaths in the salty air and the scent of the beach. &quot;The soft crashing of waves on the shoreline, the ...<em>unique</em> smell and contrasting colors.&quot;</p>
<p>Looking out into the empty expanse beyond the ocean &quot;I'm glad I finally got to see one with my own two eyes.&quot;</p>

<p>Ami cannot help but be drawn into this bizarre scene unfolding in front of her. <em>In the middle of a dance party - no, on a ship - there's a beach? Impossible!</em> she thinks, staring at the waves and sand. &quot;W-what in the world is going on here?&quot; she asks, a little louder than she originally thought.</p>

<p>Ami recoils slightly, but appreciates the cool water on her skin, and takes a few steps further into the water. &quot;It has been a long time since I even saw a beach, let alone one so pristine... it's beautiful.&quot;</p>

<p>Grug moves to the beach. As earlier, he has tied his shirt and suit jacket around his waist, leaving his formal tie around his neck. He approaches the water's edge, and stands in the sand in his dress shoes. He stands there watching. &quot;Girl is always loud, and her music is loud. Why is she loud?&quot;</p>
<p>He squats down on the beach and runs his hand through the sand. &quot;Strange sand too...&quot;</p>

<p>Both her arms swing simultaneously, hands palm up, starting in front of her and ending above her head. She does this multiple times;<em>An ingrugtational motion.</em></p>

<p>Facing the shore, she calls back to him, embarrassed at her contradiction. &quot;No no, but as long as it stays out of your eyes its <em>really</em> fun!&quot;</p>

<p>Grug steps away to avoid getting his shoes wet from the large wave breaking on the shore. &quot;Swimming for fun? When the water is moving like it would in a storm? And why would you wear clothes while swimming, they get heavy and stick to you and you must leave them out to dry. And what was that about 'salt'?&quot;</p>

<p>Confused, she calls back. &quot;You've never ever swam for fun? It feels great to be weightless in the water with the coolness against your skin... Annnnnd the clothes are for fun!&quot;</p>
<p>She realized the absurdity of the questions; this man is nothing like the people where she is from. &quot;These clothes are designed to be light in the water. Its almost like its not there-- but it is.&quot; She considers how to explain what salt is. &quot;And salt issss... what makes food taste good. Its like a rock you grind into small pieces and mix into food.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Grug has swam before, but the water... was calm! Not like this!&quot; He seems to gesture as a wave comes in. &quot;Is it safe?&quot;</p>
<p>Grug pats his suit pants. &quot;Are these clothes designed for swimming? Grug only swims for fun unclothed, but here would rather have clothes on... and 'salt,' it sounded like it hurt your eyes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If you're okay with the waves, it's plenty safe!&quot; Yumi furrows her brows, squinting at Grug as she slowly makes her way back the shore. &quot;No no, those clothes won't work. They'll get too heavy.&quot;</p>
<p>Getting closer, she explains. &quot;Salt is a lot like water, it can be used for many things! Much like you can drink water and drown in water; You can eat salt or be hurt by salt.&quot; Now shrugging, &quot;It all depends on how you use it.&quot;</p>
<p>Yumi gets closeish to Grug, letting him close the rest of the distance, and offers a bit of decorative fabric for him to touch. &quot;Here, feel this. It's very light, even in the water. If you want to swim in clothes, we can find something like this for you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A race? Gah!&quot; Grug chases after Yumi, but stumbles in the sand, going tumbling, before jumping back to his feet. Though he makes a valiant effort, Yumi is able to easily beat him to the water. &quot;Graaaah!&quot; He kicks at the muddy sand before following Yumi further in, splashing through the waves, before suddenly--&quot;Ah!&quot; Grug reaches up towards his eyes, falling into the water. &quot;It hurts mildly!&quot; He shouts, as he scrambles back up onto the beach. He rubs his eyes as he sits down.</p>

<p>Victoria sighs and retreats to a corner to take a break from socialising. Her pristine white suit and unmarked face gives no impression of what transpired overnight. However, when she walks, there is a slight drag to one of her legs. Pressing a discreet button under her sleeve, the steel contraption on her back unfolds three skeletal legs. Gently lifting off the ground, she takes out a small notebook and begins taking notes.</p>

<p>Finding herself momentarily mesmerized by the unusual display, Harrow’s attention is drawn to the woman. Thoughtful eye’s watch the contraption as it moves in an arachnid like manner. She moves closer absentmindedly out of curiosity, and then stands within adjacent proximity. Not close enough that it's obvious, but just over the shoulder, watching as she writes. Harrow doesn’t say anything, Just observing, attempting to read what it is that is being transcribed.</p>

<p>Harrow sees a series of cyphers incomprehensible to her. Victoria closes the notebook and turns to Harrow.
&quot;I don't believe we've spoken, Harrow.&quot;
Victoria gently rotates to face her, with deep metallic clicks.
&quot;I don't blame you for looking and I would be a fool to not take precautions.&quot;</p>

<p>She gives Victoria a sheepish grin. &quot;We have not. It's an interesting contraption you have there...even more interesting what one could possibly be journaling when one is supposed to be partying. Not that it's any of my business...curiosity just got the better of me for a moment. I apologize.&quot; She rests an arm on her hip, taking on a more relaxed posture.</p>
<p>&quot;Course, I'm not much of a partier myself. Even if the sake of our lives and world's were not on the line, my friends back home would find it ironic that I made a comment about you when that's been me many times at public engagements.&quot; Harrow chuckles, her tone turning more serious once finished, eyes not being able to help glancing at the closed notebook once more.</p>
<p>&quot;Have you...been able to 'reveal your secret' to anyone yet, Victoria? Off here all alone...it seems a waste for one to lose this game simply by being too absorbed in research to ‘party’. And, currently, I have nothing but time, plus, i’m a pretty good listener…&quot; She leans closer to the woman.</p>

<p>“Just wanted to say hello, and join you for a little drink.” He takes a swig of what looks like whiskey.</p>

<p>A dull, but distant guise paints her face. It appears…calm, numb to the party, eyes seeming to look past everything and everyone, gazing at something beyond the atmosphere of the room. Yet, while her expression gives off a semi-relaxed visage, Harrow’s body appears otherwise. Her fists are clenched, the muscles in her arms tensed, her posture contrasting with the guise of her face. Putting two and two together -the envelope containing tonight's instructions crinkled between tense right handed fingers- it is clear that she is not just looking past the room, but lost in some memory freezing her in place.</p>
<p>She wears a simple dress, if you'd call a strappy gold ensemble simple (https://i.imgur.com/htq9T6d.png). Silk wisps wrap around her chest and up her back where they meet at her shoulders and descend, shimmering strands caught by a gentle breeze. A rose bushel of hair finds itself tied together by its own strands in a bun atop her head, exposing the defined musculature to her back. Double pink locks frame her face and trail down the front of her figure. Elegant, yet uncomplicated, and easy to move in.</p>
<p>Eventually, with an obviously shaking inhale of air, Harrow moves to a vacant chair at an abandoned table and falls onto its frame. She looks down at the letter held in her right hand, while her left clutches at her moistened forehead. For a moment, her attention turns to where Maxamillion is in the room, a desperate gaze to her eyes. She looks down at the letter once more, then to Max, then the letter, stuck in a loop of endlessly rereading its contents.</p>

<p>The woman looks from the crumbled letter in her clutches to the girl, then past her, seemingly trapped in a distant memory. Wrinkles of distress crease around her eyes, expression twisting into something sour. Then, with a sigh, she composes herself, nodding as she begins to speak, although she refrains from looking into Seseri's gaze.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes...I have. More 'people' than I can count at this point. My first...&quot; she swallows hard, almost as if the words in her throat are desperately trying to claw their way back down her throat, &quot;My first is the one that haunts me. A girl...a child really. She was 15. She begged me not to do it but I...I was a bounty hunter with a master to please. She was a runaway, a 'criminal' escaped from a testing facility and it was my prerogative to bring her back, or kill her if she wouldn't comply.&quot;</p>
<p>She looks at the envelope containing the secret now free in the open air, her fingers smoothing out the creases nervously. &quot;She didn't comply. So I did what I was instructed to do,&quot; her voice croaks.</p>
<p>Harrow looks at Seseri, a pleading glint in her eyes, &quot;Perhaps killing someone as a mercy isn't such a bad thing? Considering, at the time, your intentions were honorable?&quot; She smiles at Seseri sincerely.</p>

<p><em>&quot;I'm sorry that you had to go through that... poor girl.&quot;</em> Seseri closes her eyes and sighs softly.
<em>&quot;I definitely <strong>thought</strong> it was a mercy at the time. She was... a young girl by the name of Eira, a teenager really. She had the heart of an explorer, like us, but she had more heart than sense. She went exploring the shroud without proper training and by the time any proper rescue reached her, it was too late. She had been twisted and mutated by the corruptive darkness which blankets our world... her inner flame extinguished, parasitic growths covering her. As far as we know... there is no way to cure that kind of corruption, and every moment would've been agony for her. So I put her out of her misery... my note says she could've been saved. That I cut her life short for nothing.&quot;</em> Seseri shudders as she hands Harrow the note.</p>

<p>She didn't expect such openness, Seseri actually handing Harrow the note to see for herself. So, Harrow did the same, trading her crinkled letter for Seseri's. On Harrow's note, at the bottom, you notice the words, <em>You took her name, and never mourned her. Her family never knew what happened.</em></p>
<p>&quot;Seseri...it seems you and I share similar secrets. Young girls, teenagers, lives cut too short.&quot; A sigh ripples through Harrow's chest, her shoulders shaking with grief. &quot;As sad as I am to know that we share a similar guilt, I’m strangely comforted by this. You know, I also wish, knowing what I struggled through, that such things were never forced on us - that we never had to live in a timeline where endring these weight's were our's to bear.&quot; Harrow pat's Seseri's hand.</p>
<p>&quot;The note says she could have been saved, yes, but...at the time, you didn't know that, did you? Taking a life should never be easy, but if you had never heard of a cure before, even if one existed, you can't hold that against yourself. Can I ask though, if you have any idea <em>how</em> could she have been saved? Or is that part of the mystery that this letter plagues you with?&quot;</p>

She doesn't look up immediantely. &quot;Not very well Ami...the contense of the letter...the secret we have to tell others, its something I've never told anyone - much less a stranger. Time is waisting and I am finding it harder and harder to reveal...&quot; She crinkles the note she was just reading in between a clenched fist and heaves a heavy sigh.</p>
<p>Finally, she looks up at you, down, and then back up, a weary smile painting her face. &quot;You look lovely too Ami...are you enjoying the party? Danced with anyone interesting? I'm Harrow by the way,&quot; the woman extends a scorched left hand to you in greeting.</p>

<p>Ami takes Harrow's hand, careful to be gentle. &quot;I know how you feel. I'm... not exactly sure how I feel about telling someone a secret I've kept close for so long, especially in this type of circumstance.&quot;</p>

<p>The woman meets Ami's grasp, equally as gentle, yet there is a touch starved desperation in her clutch. &quot;Well...if It would help you...I could go first. Believe me, after you hear mine, I doubt you will feel so ashamed of your own,&quot; her lips curl into a sympathetic smile.</p>

<p>Seseri slowly walks into the room, clutching the side of her head, her free hand holding her now-removed mask. Under her mask her eyes can be seen glowing a deep red, her face squinting in slight pain.</p>
<p>Finding a comfortable-looking chair, Seseri unceremoniously collapses on top of it and looks around the room.</p>

<p>The music stops.</p>
<p>Maximillian suddenly rises from his throne. Silently, he begins to descend from his perch high above the dancefloor. With every dozen steps a new person followed behind the ruler, culminating into another <a href="https://imgur.com/WeVdzBD">conga line of the boys</a>. Shortly after, <a href="https://youtu.be/bvj25SpFUJ8">new music</a> begins to play throughout the hall.</p>
<p>The room flashes with a brilliant light that casts shadows across the entire party hall. Outside the ship, whichever world they had been orbiting for the past day had been struck by something truly disastrous and was now thrust into the rapid process of its own obliteration. The explosive spectacle sent chunks of rock and magma every which way. Some collide into the ship only to be vaporized on contact by some sort of force field. Every person onboard was getting front row tickets to this hapless world's annihilation.</p>
<p>Almost as suddenly as all of this began, the world was all but gone, minus a lingering debris field quickly scattering into space. In an instant the ship orbited a new world, and again, it, like the last world, was destroyed in much the same fashion. With each world's destruction came a flash of its unique identifier along the ship's window panes. In that vein, every contender in Maximillian's abhorrent game knew at that point the identification of their own world -- &quot;Earth-&quot; followed by a string of numbers and letters.</p>
<p>Fortunately, no world belonging to the current players met such a terrible fate... yet. After nearly twenty minutes of awful destruction the ship began to cycle through each of the champion's worlds one after another, viewing it from orbit for one minute before cycling to the next, repeating until the night finally arrived.</p>

<p>Grug climbs some stairs, up to a balcony, overlooking the massive window, watching the destruction of worlds. He wears nothing but swim trunks, still dripping wet from his excursion with Yumi.</p>
<p>&quot;Please, grant me the music of the gods for this!&quot; He shouts to no one in particular, as he turns back around to face the rest of the passengers, his arms lifted high in the air. He freezes in that moment for several seconds, but is blessed as someone, who knows who, begins to play <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp56lFQ0-Q4">music</a>.</p>
<p>&quot;Grug is here to let all of you know! Grug is mighty! Grug will not allow Maximilian to destroy his world! For the Gods he will prove his world is perfect! As he stands here, this will not be the last you all see of Grug! He will be there, greeting the survivors at the end! He will not go quietly, and <em>he</em> will save his world!&quot;</p>
<p>Grug pauses momentarily. &quot;Grug wishes for the survival of as many as possible, but knows not everyone will be able to make it. For everyone who can survive, Grug will be happy to meet your friends and family who you will save from the wrath of Maximilian before he is moved to the next round to fight once again and prove the perfection of his home! May they all meet Grug, Grug the genius! Grug the eventual victor, no matter how many games he is forced to play, Grug will rise above as he always has, like no other man! To die this night is not even a consideration for Grug, for none here are mightier than he!&quot; He clenches a fist,  raising that arm higher, lowering his other arm.</p>
<p>&quot;To Grug's victory! In the words of these Gods, 'Prosit!'&quot; Grug mimes throwing a glass down with his clenched hand.</p>
<p>Suddenly, his shoulders slump. &quot;And to all who must fight for their lives and their homes and their Earths tonight... good luck.&quot;</p>
<p>Grug leaves the balcony much less bombastic than he was before, speed-walking down the stairs.</p>

<p>Mabel watches Grug off with her hands clasped at her chest. She's still in shock over the cacophony of worlds being destroyed, but resolutely hung onto his every word.</p>
<p>&quot;Prosit, Grug... I wish the best for you, your people, and... your loved ones.&quot;</p>
