<p>Vegael, quite literally, did not know what to do. It wasn't like she's ever had a vacation before; not then, not now. She knew what one was, she wasn't ignorant. But, even if she was given the opportunity to plan for a vacation a month in advance... What <em>does</em> one do during a vacation? Vacations were supposed to be pleasant, right?</p>
<p>So, given that, the plane-person stepped over to the nearest object of familiarity: the generator chugging away, powering the tiki bar and kitchen. She pulled up the nearest chair, took a seat next to it, and simply... listened to it running.</p>

<p>Victor strolls over to Vegael with a bemused look on his face.
&quot;Hey, something the matter? This remind you of home? Ahaha, just joking.&quot;
He leans against the generator and raps it with his knuckles, smirking.
&quot;The name's Victor, I'm one of the staff round here. You look like you might be a little out of sorts? Don't worry, this place can be a little confusing at first. Now I'm financially, and more importantly, morally obligated to make your stay as pleasant as possible, so let me know if there's anything I can do to accommodate ya'.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It does. It has been three years since I've last heard a running engine. And, admittedly, this place is unusual, but I believe myself to have a grasp of it at this point.&quot;
Vegael's interest was caught by his last statement, however.
&quot;Financially and morally obligated? Does that mean you can... I should ask first, what <em>are</em> you able to acquire?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, if there are any food items, drinks, clothing, swimming equipment, books, portable music or video devices, furniture items, emergency medical items...&quot; he counts on his fingers as he continues to list various generic resort amenities. He seems to have done his best to memorise most of them  &quot;... that we can get you, just say the word, and we'll do our best to provide.&quot;</p>
<p>He glances over at Jonathan, his boss.
&quot;And by 'we', I mean mainly me. Yeah. Basically just me. Also, if you have any questions, I can try to answer those. Folks round here come from all sorts of... backgrounds, so don't feel embarrassed to ask if you don't know what a 'fork' or a 'bathroom' is or something.&quot;</p>

<p>Vegael gave him a deadpan stare.
&quot;I may have been living on five dollars a day, back at home, but I am very sure I know what a 'fork' is. And on the procurement note... would you happen to be able to acquire JP-8-Grade Aviation Jet Fuel?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ooooh, JP-8 you say... JP-8-Grade...&quot;
Victor strokes his chin mysteriously.
&quot;I will definitely <em>check</em> whether we have that in stock. Yes. We do have... propane? For barbecues? I can get you some of that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh and a heads up, don't worry about money here. Your five dollars is secure. Everything is on the house for you guys! I mean we have vending machines, but you don't have to use those! They are a ripoff!&quot; Victor smiles confidently.</p>

<p>&quot;I do not believe propane is safe for me to consume, if it is even possible. Is it not natural gas? And what is the point of the vending machines, then?&quot;
Vegael was beginning to question the logistical acuity of the individuals running this place.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, yeah definitely don't consume that. That's a major no-go health and safety hazard. I'm not gonna spout off the health and safety rules, because you are all normal cool adults, but that's definitely one of them. Like it doesn't matter if it's natural or not, you will still probably die.&quot;</p>
<p>Victor is caught off guard by the vending machine question. He catches himself.
&quot;Oh, right, forgot to tell you dudes! This place is like, a normal resort most of the time you know. Hey, gotta make money somehow! Again, you guys are like, staying here for free. All-inclusive. But yeah a lot of the year I have to deal with kids running around and teenagers trying to smuggle booze out of the gift shop.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yep! We got the outdoor and indoor ones both! Pick what you prefer.&quot;
Victor points over to a fairly utilitarian-looking building nestled in a small outcrop of trees.
&quot;Showers and toilets in there, and you can see the outdoor showers on the side of that wall there.&quot;</p>
<p>He wildly gestures over to one of the walls as he continues to ramble on.
&quot;Water might be a bit cold on those, though. Just the normal soap and scentless shampoo inside, but should be a decent selection of shampoo and the like in your room. If there ain't, uh... don't tell the boss okay, I'll get you some.</p>
<p>Oh! And if you need any... specific hygiene products, I'll do my best to grab em right away! No engine oil though! Might gum up the pipes! Haha, only joking.&quot;</p>

<p>Victor looks a little surprised that someone is going around handing out soap of all things. After a moment, he gives a small shrug and goes back to smiling.

<p>Vegael didn't realize that she hadn't actually told Ferg she could fly, so his reaction came as a slight surprise.
&quot;Oh, er. Yes, I do fly. Not like a bird, though, I'm not a bird. Where I'm from, they figured out how to put wings on people. So, I'm still part-human, at least.&quot;</p>

She spread her arm out, to reveal the full extent of her wing. Or rather, what was left of it. The last third of both of her wings had been snipped off, the ends crimped together in a very rough, ragged manner.
&quot;My wings were cut off years ago.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Maimed? That is... one way to describe it. But no, I didn't lose my wings in battle. The country I fought for, I suppose to you it'd be something like a tribe, they told me to fight in this one war. Then they blamed me for fighting in it. And when I tried to argue with them, they cut my wings and threw me aside.&quot;
Vegael's voice was tinged with sadness.</p>

<p>The wood floors creaked with his approach and a shadow appeared over Vegael blocking the sun. You hear a rich voice with smooth timbre, a hint of a smile seeping into the tone.
If you look up a taller fellow stands before you with a kind grin adorning his face.
&quot;You mind if I sit here?&quot;
He gestures to the open bar stool beside Vegael.</p>

<p>The two fin-shaped headpieces on Vegael's head (Wings? Antenna? Radar, of sorts?) twitched as he approached. She glanced up at the bald man, with her red-and-grey eyes, then looked back down at the running generator.

<p>&quot;That view? It was...&quot;
Vegael turned her head up, to gaze at the sky.
&quot;Have you ever flown before? In a plane, a helicopter, or god forbid, braved skydiving? Everything beneath you is shrunken away, blanketed and shadowed in a thin layer of clouds just above it. Anything in the distant horizon fades into shades of blue and white, and for a moment, you simply <em>wish</em> you could stay there, indefinitely, watching as everyone on the surface goes along with their daily lives...&quot;
There was a longing in her voice.
&quot;That was the most beautiful view I have ever seen, forty-five thousand Continental Units above sea level.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I've been on a plane quite a few times over the years, flying now is a lot different than it used to be. Only considered sky diving once for an ad for the company. Managed to weasel my way out of it and do a different Super Bowl ad instead.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The way you describe it does sound breathtaking, it sounds like something worth missing, something worth fighting for.&quot;</p>

<p>He turns her direction seemingly catching the change in tone, but choosing not to prod further at the moment.
&quot;Names Mr. Clean, if you want to drop the Mr. you can call me James.&quot;
He offers you hand and a smile.
&quot;Advertising can be tough business, but once you get the hang of reading the room it becomes a bit easier. You have to know your audience, what they want, what they need. You have to figure out where people are coming from. I'll say it has made making friends a lot easier over the years.&quot;</p>

&quot;Glad to meet you, Mr. Clean. It sounds like quite a helpful skill-set, this advertising. Knowing people? That is something I have not been particularly... skilled in.&quot;

<p>Vegael seemed to ponder that question. She responded, two minutes later. Her words were slow, seemingly deliberate.
&quot;Now that I think over it... I am not quite sure. But one thing my lawyer did tell me was that the way I deliver my messaging was very... It did not look good, to say the least. But I simply say things as they are; how else is there to say it?&quot;</p>

<p>At this point his gaze has flickered back to the bird over head, one landing below a palm tree and seemingly picking at something on the ground.

<p>Vegael gave a slow nod, listening to Mr. Clean speak.
&quot;I have heard such sayings before, that you should not mind what others believe. As long as you have integrity. But when it is everyone who thinks of me so poorly, then it does become impossible to ignore.&quot;
When she turned her head, to glance back at the chugging generator, the right side of her hoodie's collar could be seen by the man. Stamped right across there was the word <strong><strong>CONDEMNED</strong></strong> in red, bold lettering.</p>

<p>He hums again, somber this time, but still with a slight smile.
&quot;It does become difficult to ignore when those who think poorly of you have control over your life. I understand the need to keep up appearances to maintain your place in the world.&quot;
He takes a breath as the young bird in front of them, seemingly done pecking through the sand opens its wings, catching a gust of wind and once again taking flight.
&quot;It's easy to tell someone to ignore what others say, I concur, but it's a string of hope I like to hold onto. Freedom does not come cheaply, but with hard work, I believe it is still possible for anyone.&quot;</p>

Vegael's words trailed off. It seemed as though she did not know what to say next, or she had nothing left to say, in general. She sat there, with the generator humming in the background, and the occasional tweet of birds.
&quot;Your... 'world', if I am correct to call it that. I am curious what you advertise. You mentioned a skydiving advertisement that you got out of? From your name alone, I would guess... cleaning supplies, of sorts? But the consideration for skydiving does throw me for a loop.&quot;</p>

<p>With that, he hops up, gives a wink and a twirl, and appears in his oldest cartoon form.</p>
<p>He then proceeds to perform his very first 1958 advertisement for you, making quite the spectacle of it.</p>




<p>When he finishes, he bows and transforms back into his current less cartoonish form.</p>

<p>&quot;Back then ads were simple, though I will admit the content is a bit dated for today. Nowadays to catch people's attention you have to be a bit more creative to get people's attention, especially for a big event like the Super Bowl, hence why the company originally suggested sky diving. In the end, we still had quite the attention grabber of an ad that year, but a different feel than they were originally going for.&quot;</p>
<p>He ends this comment gazing off, seemingly finding something amusing in that last statement but, ends his statement there.</p>
<p>&quot;What about you, what did you do for work?&quot;</p>

<p>Vegael seemed surprised, at the very least, by the sudden transformation.</p>
<p>Her expression didn't change much; at least, she didn't seem like the type to break a smile so openly. But she was sitting up a little straighter and spoke in a slightly more upbeat tone.</p>
<p>&quot;It <em>is</em> quite a catchy tune. That makes me wonder how you can have an advertisement that's bigger than that... At least, I would give the product a try, that was, if I had the money. But I don't think Continental money is good here.&quot;</p>
<p>The plane-person pulled some change from her pockets, foreign coins of assorted size. Most were in poor condition. She pocketed those coins again, and looked up at Mr. Clean's last question.</p>
<p>&quot;What I do for work? I used to...&quot;
She paused. Her voice had this saddening undertone.
&quot;Well, I run a scrapyard now, as the sole employee. Not near as extravagant as advertising, but it's something.&quot;</p>

<p>He gives a warm smile as he sits down and looks you in the eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, friend! Honest work is honest work, you look like the type to know your stuff in your world. I'd trust you from the limited conversation we have had here.&quot;</p>
<p>He quirks his head and reaches into his pocket and then behind him.</p>
<p>&quot;No need for money here, I have a feeling that it has no place in our current situation.&quot;
&quot;I doubt you will find any use for this in our current situation either, but you can have these if you would like to try them later!&quot;</p>
<p>He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a Mr. Clean magic eraser which almost seems to apparate into his hands as from the outside his pockets appear empty. He reaches behind him and a bottle of Mr. Clean lemon scented cleaner appears he takes both and places them on the bar counter. As a gesture of goodwill, although strange he offers them to you.</p>

<p>He looks over to Vegael in for confirmation and makes an executive decision.
&quot;You are not interrupting please join us!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I appreciate the gift.&quot;</p>

<p>“Thank you. This is all so strange to me. Demonic beings, parallel worlds?”</p>
<p>Sariya glances over at the pair in the distance.</p>
<p>“It’s like something out of one of Pushkin’s fairy tales. I apologize, I haven’t introduced myself. You can call me Korya. It’s not the name my parents gave me but it’s what I’ve been called the past two decades.”</p>

<p>He glances back at her.
&quot;Wish I could give more, but at the moment I only have cleaning products on me. Small quirk I suppose.&quot;</p>

<p>He turns and offers his hand and a smile.
&quot;Hello Korya, I am familiar with given and chosen names, my company gave me an odd first name back in the early days so I chose my own name later on. You can call me Mr. Clean, James if you would like to drop the Mr.&quot;</p>
<p>He glances off two the two more imposing figures.
&quot;Demons and parallel worlds do seem quite odd, but I have seen strange beings before, just have to get to know them better is all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;More than alright, it is one of my names!&quot;
&quot;On my Earth, the most recent world war we had was World War 2 which ended in 1945, there have been plenty of wars since then, but none on that scale. There were the Axis and the Allies if that is what you are referring to. The Allies won which America was part of and that did help contribute to America being a superpower, though these days countries like China and Russia don't seem too far behind.&quot;</p>

&quot;Other than good motor oil, or high-octane jet fuel. If either can somehow be procured, which I will gladly appreciate.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have no issues with doing what is needed to live,&quot; Vegael said. &quot;The premise of this... resort, has me hesitate to call it 'beautiful' in any way, though. Beautiful in a surface-level appearance, perhaps. I am quite sure the underlying workings are far more dubious.&quot;</p>

&quot;My name was... impressive? What?&quot;

<p>The d12 spins beneath the robe with a subtle force, landing on 11. The shopkeeper barely moves, their posture drooping with the same lethargy. &quot;Well, that could’ve been handled a little differently. Could’ve been smoother, I suppose. You’ll figure it out next time, I’m sure.&quot; They breathe out softly, a hint of impatience creeping into their tone as they wait for something to happen.</p>

<p>The d12 shifts beneath the robe with a rhythmic roll, landing squarely on 6. The shopkeeper leans forward, their posture suddenly more alert, and their staff twirls in their hand. &quot;Not the usual crowd, but I suppose you’ll do. Shopkeeper. I deal in magic, you know, run my own shop in Heroesburg. The most mundane thing in that city, honestly. That’s where I’m always needed—whether I want it or not.&quot; A brief flash of excitement dances through their motion as they stare fixated on you, ready for whatever comes next.</p>

<p>Vegael nodded, after finally getting a bit of a more coherent answer.
&quot;A magic shop, hm? Like in those fairy tales? I figured, given your... unusual nature, Mister Shopkeeper. What kind of magic do you do business in? Or, rather... how would you describe it? I'm not from a land with 'magic', you see?&quot;</p>

<p>The d12 rolls with a bit more energy now, as if finding a little drive, and lands on 7. The shopkeeper straightens, their posture almost regal as they steady their staff. &quot;This is unusual, I usually don’t care. I don’t usually get drawn in, but something’s got me now. I’ll entertain it for a while, but no promises.&quot; They let out a long exhale, their attention glancing around the room as if they'd rather be anywhere else.</p>

<p>A towering man stares at the host as he speaks, unblinking. His ice cold gaze only moves for a moment to look at the paper within the envelope, that he quickly disappears in his pocket.</p>
<p>&quot;Very well.&quot; His rumbling voice can be heard across the room, steady and poised. With a few big steps he's arms crossed near the counter, observing the area with clinical eye.</p>
<p>Moments later, he proclaims to whoever is within earshot: &quot;I am Kal-Ei. And you all, you will walk away either an ally, or a corpse. Make your choice.&quot;</p>

<p>Kal-Ei turns to stare at you, crackling of electricity surrounding his arms for a moment before vanishing. &quot;There is only one philosophy for a true ruler: the sacrifice of self to the Crown. To be the highest of Lords means to be its ultimate servant.&quot;</p>
<p>He pauses for a moment, taking in any reaction. &quot;Strength and kindness are two tools of a single purpose. But those who use their status to take instead of giving, they are no true kings.&quot; His voice crackles with thunder. &quot;Which one are you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am afraid the answer to that has changed through the ages.&quot; The man gazes into the distance, suddenly far away from there. &quot;Eons after eons, I watched it grow.

That's in the past now.&quot; A heavy pause fills the air. &quot;I do hope a better outcome for your kingdom. May it last tenfold, for it seems it is being governed by a wise queen.&quot;</p>

<p>The lamb turns to large man and listens. After he is done she cautiously walks up to the large man in almost silence. When shes a few metres away she cocks her head. &quot;Do you control death?....... Are you the one all things must meet at the end of their lives?&quot;</p>
<p>She begins to stalk around him cautiously and observantly. Before eventually stopping on the other side of him and standing up straight. &quot;You are bold to proclaim you are the one that chooses when someone dies. You may kill then but it was not you who decided they will die.&quot;</p>
<p>Staring up blankly at the man the hollowed out eye sockets on her mask appear to shine a brighter blue. &quot;That is the task of the grey man... You are not the grey man. I-...&quot; The brightness vanishes and looks slightly down. &quot;The grey man?.... Who is that?... Is that wha- no, who I was?&quot; There is obvious confusion in her voice.</p>

<p>Cocking her head in the other direction she goes on. &quot;Who am I?. I-                   Am Lamb... What I am? I do not know.

<p>&quot;Only those that will deserve it, girl.&quot; Despite your attempt at leaving some space between you two, he seems intentioned on speaking face to face.

<p>As he steps forward, Vegael appears to become visibly more on-guard. She tries not to show it, but her body language does betray said wariness: she is leaning back a little, the two antenna-like headpieces on her head were rotating back and forth, like flaps. Her left hand climbs a bit, nearing where the three red stripes on her hoodie were.</p>
<p>&quot;I am Vegael. Callsi-&quot;
She stops herself right there. The lass appears visibly annoyed; not at him, but at having to stop herself from saying something she did not wish to say.
&quot;Vegael. Nothing else. Forgive my wariness, for I have heard plenty from individuals who claim righteousness to an extent before. What is your name?&quot;</p>

&quot;I have not been able to fly for years,&quot; she said, stretching out one arm to show the full length of her wing. The last third of that wing had been clipped off, the ends of it crimped together to close the 'wound'.
&quot;Even if my wings were not in this condition, I have not had a good meal in a long time. Used motor oil, mostly. I very much doubt my engines would appreciate burning that, if they were in any condition to burn anything.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We all die eventually. Perhaps I encountered this sooner and more literally than most, but back where I'm from, it was basically a fact of life. If you fear death... when it stares you in the face, you die. Simple as that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We'll see who has the backbone for it when the time comes.&quot;</p>

<p>The d12 rolls under the robe like it's a sickly animal, its movements painfully slow, landing on 2. The shopkeeper stands straighter, though it's obvious they're holding back a yawn. &quot;So, that’s your big move? It’s like you’re trying to ruin any hope of success. Let me guess: you’ve been training for years to make that mistake? You’ve got all the right skills, just none of the right results.&quot; They shake their head twice, staring you down as if expecting you to offer something impressive.</p>

<p>The d12 rolls sluggishly, like it's dragged out of bed, barely managing to land on 1. The shopkeeper taps their staff harder than necessary, head leaning back slightly. &quot;Oh, fantastic. You just reinvented the wheel, except it’s square. I mean, wow. Just when I thought you couldn’t get any worse, you somehow find a way. I’m genuinely curious how you managed to make something so simple look like a disaster.&quot; They scoff, muttering under their breath as they tap their staff in irritation.</p>

<p>The d12 rolls under the robe like it's been jolted awake, landing roughly on 5. The shopkeeper flicks their staff with a flourish, though it’s more a gesture of disdain than style. &quot;Ah yes, the patented failure technique. Who needs logic when you’ve got... whatever that was? I’m sure you’ll somehow mess it up again, just wait.&quot; They tilt their head dramatically, giving you a slow, exaggerated nod, clearly waiting for something worth their time.</p>

<p>The d12 shifts with a surge of energy, landing with an exaggerated thud on 11. The shopkeeper snaps their staff down with a nonchalant flick, barely paying attention. &quot;I could just... explode right now, but I’ll be nice. I’m sure this will all work out in the end.

<p>Just when you thought you were in the clear, while still looking at the rest of the room he starts flicking your forehead, again and again and again.</p>
<p>Flick

<p>Every time the d12 doesn't land on a 12 there a little more force behind the next flick, though not quite enough to actually hurt. All the while, he keeps looking in the distance as if you didn't even exist, as if you were some sort of overgrown fidget toy.</p>

<p>“Intriguing…” A whirlwind of ash exits a bungalow, forming into the shape of a man. Cendre stops as they reach the main walkway, reaching inside their own body and pulling out a journal and pen. They begin writing sporadically as they survey the new environment in front of them. “What kind of performance can I expect here? Can I take inspiration from a genius, a fool? Perhaps…even…” They stop, and with a resounding slap they close the journal as they suddenly stand at attention before brushing themselves off, ash floating from them as they hold their chin and continue looking around. The ash suddenly swirls and solidifies into a pale man next to them, a sickly monochrome scholar dressed in barely fitting robes.</p>
<p>“Hmm?” Cendre turns towards the man, who narrows his eyes and shakes his head. The masked figure waves them off. “Oh Marx. You don’t see the possibilities of such a locale. Look around you…so many opportunities!” More ash comes off them, growing into the shape of a massive bare-chested man who grunts silently with his arms crossed, a scowl forming on their face. With a small spin, Cendre puts a hand on the man’s hip, leaning against them nonchalantly. “Honestly Rod. Now is hardly the time. Enjoy the moment for once!” The ashen man turns towards Cendre and then looks down at the other sickly man. They both stare each other down for quite a while, the scholar silently saying something but the giant of a man scoffing and raising a fist while responding, however no sounds come out of their mouth at all. Cendre shrugs and spreads his hands. “As always, you two never get along.” They brush their hands through both, the two men fading back to ash and falling away before rejoining Cendre, who walks back to the bungalow and takes a seat in a nearby chair. They start to hum as they write, occasionally scraping paper and tossing it behind them with the pages scattering to dust. “Perhaps this will help me past my latest writer’s block…”</p>

<p>Cendre turns to the new arrival at their bungalow, nodding to her. “Ahh, you must be one of the other guests I hear also has magic in their world. Though, I’m afraid that my body of ash and the shades are more akin to a curse than magic. That isn’t to say we cannot use it, however.”</p>
<p>Snapping his fingers, nearby tiki torches light up with purple fire, though it quickly becomes a regular flame. “Personally, I am proficient in fire and dark magic. There is a shade inside us that is much more magically adept, but she lost the majority of her magic when she became a shade. She is limited to the same elements I am as well.”</p>

<p>“Ahh, a queen!” Cendre bows deeply, before coming up to a straight stance. “My name is Cendre, your majesty” They brush a little ash off their shoulder, at it seems to hover there next to them for a moment as an eye seems to appear in it before quickly vanishing. Cendre seems to notice it but turns back to Elissandra. “We say curse, but in reality…it was the convergence of many. The fall of a kingdom…”</p>
<p>They go quiet for a moment but then shake their head and instead gesture towards Ellisandra. “Your kingdom. What is it like? This Azuria?”</p>

<p>&quot;Preferable to the alternative...&quot; Cendre puts a hand on their mask, glaring at seemingly nothing for the moment. &quot;Can one call that a choice? When one is given an opportunity to choose but in reality there is only one option?&quot; They wildly shake their head, ash coming off them wildly for a moment before their body reforms. &quot;Forgive me. We know not what your circumstances were.&quot; Cendre bows their head slightly in apology before standing back upright.</p>

<p>Cendre’s head turns towards the man nearby, though their mask doesn’t really show where exactly they are looking. “Writer. Musician. Cursed Monster. Abomination. We’ve been called many, many things. Peculiar is one of the kinder words used to describe us.”</p>

<p>“My own story…” Cendre appears to look up, but its still difficult to tell with his mask. “My story is a song that persists through the ruins of the that once great kingdom where these shades come from.

<p>The ash coming off Cendre’s body begins to form something until they turn and step into it. Whoever the shade was returns to their body without fully forming as they begin to speak. “Ahh, we’re afraid you are mistake sir. This ash is our body.” Lifting a hand they snap, the remaining ash around them being absorbed practically immediately. After a moment it begins to wisp off them again as they lower their hand. “We’re sorry if it bothers you, but it’s just the way we are.”</p>

<p>“Hmm, what is it like indeed? How would one accurately describe their own world?” Cendre muses, holding their chin and turning their head slightly to the left. “I suppose…given that most people here at least <em>appear</em> human in some form or another describing humanity seems like a logical choice.”</p>
<p>Cendre nods before looking back at Mr. Clean. “My world’s humans have many nations, spread out across the world alongside other intelligent races. Dwarfs, elves, among others. I’ve seen many kingdoms rise and fall, though I suppose over the last century or so their usual decline has slowed with the rise of groups spanning nations, certain faiths and guilds. Their ability to use magic has grown, though they’re likely to fly too close to the sun again sooner or later.”</p>

<p>The smile of Cendre’s mask brightens a bit. “Of course. The Children of the Sun, my first book.” Cendre’s hand reaches inside themself, pulling out an old leather bound book with a sun emblazoned on it. “My original copy is unreadable…unless you happen to know how to read Solaria’s dead language like me. The stories inside are loosely based on the kingdom’s Six Talents.”</p>

<p>&quot;I doubt I could read it, but if there are short stories in there I'm sure the group would love to hear you read one later, perhaps around a campfire on the beach or the tiki bar.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As for my world, I would hazard to guess in comparision that your world is more magically advanced and mine is more technologically advanced. From what I can tell so far, in my world we mascots hold much more power than most mascots in other worlds, and I learned recently in one, while the product with me on it was there, I didn't exist.

<p>Victor approaches the bizarre humanoid quizzically.
&quot;Hey there, something the matter? Don't worry dude, this place can be a little strange to adjust to for some, but I assure you it's gonna be the best vacation of your life!&quot;</p>
<p>He tries to look the d12 in the eyes reassuringly, but runs into obvious problems.
&quot;Seriously though, you need something? I'm Victor, I work here.&quot;</p>

<p>The d12 rolls with a bit more energy now, as if finding a little drive, and lands on 7. The shopkeeper taps their staff on the floor with quiet authority. &quot;Well, well. A rare encounter, how lovely. I’m from Heroesburg, in case you haven’t guessed. Run my little shop, live a simple life… most days. But, it’s what I do. Keeps the lights on.&quot; They let out a long exhale, their attention glancing around the room as if they'd rather be anywhere else.</p>

Victor tries to take everything in stride. He goes back to smiling.
&quot;I'm sure it's a great shop! But I mean, you're on vacation at the moment, dude! Why the long face? Uh... pun intended.&quot;</p>

<p>The d12 rolls with a brief flicker, stopping firmly on 9. The shopkeeper straightens, their posture almost regal as they steady their staff. &quot;Is that supposed to be funny? You’ve got a little trickster vibe, huh? Though, I’m not sure it’ll be as funny tomorrow.&quot; Their hands remain still as they observe you quietly, waiting for the next exchange.</p>

<p>The d12 rolls with a brief flicker, stopping firmly on 9. The shopkeeper barely moves, their posture drooping with the same lethargy. &quot;Let’s just move past that, shall we? There’s no need to keep this conversation on that. I’ll spare you the details.&quot; They watch you closely, their tone slightly sharper as if they expect more now.</p>

<p>The d12 clinks and clacks with a groan before settling heavily on 3. The shopkeeper adjusts their robe with a mock sense of urgency. &quot;Well, look at this. A new face... How original. I run a shop. Magic stuff. Yeah, it’s not as interesting as it sounds. It’s mostly just ‘find the thing you lost’ or ‘fix my broken sword.’ I mean, really, people come in asking for magic, but they can’t even tell a real magical item from junk.&quot; They shake their head twice, staring you down as if expecting you to offer something impressive.</p>

<p>The d12 lurches with an almost violent force, thumping on 4 with an air of apathy. The shopkeeper leans in with feigned interest, though it’s clear they’re just humoring you. &quot;What’s up with the intense look? Got a big question for me? Let me guess, you think it’s going to be a groundbreaking discovery. But really, I’m not holding my breath.&quot; They give you a dry, motionless stare, clearly unimpressed and waiting for you to stop being boring.</p>

<p>Cendre laughs a little, shrugging before spreading his hands out. &quot;A groundbreaking discovery would be fantastic, but I'm merely looking for stories to help me write my books.

<p>The d12 rolls with a deliberate grace, coming to a smooth stop on 8. The shopkeeper leans forward, their posture suddenly more alert, and their staff twirls in their hand. &quot;Did I mention that I’m basically a living legend? I make everything look effortless. It’s just who I am. I suppose I could teach you, but it might overwhelm you.&quot; They glance at you with a hint of mild curiosity, as though they’re waiting for something better.</p>

<p>“A living legend?” Cendre begins to circle the d12, the permanent smile on his mask now appearing just a little brighter. “Do the children of your world yearn for the stories about you before their bedtime? Do the bards <em>SING</em> praises of your deeds to the people of taverns and plazas!?” The man of ash’s head practically snaps to the side as he produces his journal and pen. “Do authors like me write of you so the future generations can hear of them?”</p>

<p>The d12 moves under the robe with a slow, deliberate roll, finally resting on 5. The shopkeeper gives a faint nod, though it's more of a neutral acknowledgment. &quot;I could tell you how incredible I am, but where would I start? Every single thing I touch turns to greatness. It’s hard being this fantastic, but I manage.&quot; They tilt their head slightly, considering what to say next, but don’t make a move.</p>

<p>A small amber ring glows somewhere to your right that is quickly accompanied by a sickly sweet scent. Beside you a small hobbit is taking small drags out of his pipe.

<p>The d12 rolls with purpose, landing with precision on 10. The shopkeeper taps their staff against the floor once, gently. &quot;Well, you’re certainly... different. I’m just your average shopkeeper, nothing fancy. Heroesburg is home, where I manage things. It’s not always glamorous. But, it’s what I do.

&quot;Well friend, What do you make of all this?&quot;</p>

<p>The d12 spins beneath the robe with a subtle force, landing on 11. The shopkeeper gives an absent-minded flick of their staff, looking unbothered. &quot;Hmm, a bit underwhelming.

<p>The hobbit quietly slips a familiar pamphlet out of his breast pocket for a moment before tucking it away again.
&quot;Assuming yours reads anything like mine I'd say we have a little more to worry about than being able to bounce back. That Victor fellow mentioned some more than concerning things about how our time here might be spent. At least the atmosphere is comforting.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Heyyy, someone enjoying the place! Something I like to see.&quot;
Victor comes over and watches Ferg play with the sand. He extends a hand and then retracts it as he gleans the mannerisms of the man before him.
&quot;It's a nice place, huh? This resort. I mean, this... beach. Probably better than your... your uh... hut? Cave? Whatever, man. I just hope you enjoy your stay.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My name's Victor. Vic-tor W-ha-ya-t&quot;. Victor slowly pronounces the individual syllables of his name, exaggerating the sounds, as he continues to stare at the man.
&quot;I um... <em>live</em> here. Let me know if <em>I</em>,&quot; (he points to himself) &quot;can do anything for <em>you</em>.&quot; (he points to Ferg).</p>

<p>&quot;Oh.&quot;
Victor shakes his head slightly with his eyes closed then looks back at Ferg
&quot;My apologies, friend. Nah, I don't think you're stupid, just sometimes the... diverse nature of our guests leads to language issues. A bungalow, huh? Sounds nice.&quot;</p>
<p>He continues on as he takes Ferg's hand and shakes it.
&quot;Anyway, I can get you any sort of food, drink, clothing, furniture, whatever you need to make your stay here as comfortable as possible. I can also answer any questions you might have? But hey, if you just wanna keep looking for seashells, that's allllll good by me, man. Glad someone is taking initiative.&quot;</p>

<p>The d12 shifts under the robe with a soft clink, like it's been caught in a lazy breeze, landing on 3. The shopkeeper brushes a stray thread from their sleeve, as though fixing a minor imperfection. &quot;Well, look who’s wandered in. What a sight. I live in Heroesburg. People know me for my magic shop, but you’d probably just call it a ‘place to get what you need.’ It’s not all glamorous, though. Lots of paperwork. Ugh.&quot; A small, tilt of their dice face stares as they evaluate you for a moment, awaiting a response.</p>

<p>As Ferg asks, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB6YotDQ_ow">music begins to emanate from Shopkeeper</a>. He shakes his head, does a frantic unintelligible charade while hopping up and down for a second before calmly coming to a standstill. After a moment -- music still pouring out. mind you -- he continues.</p>
<p>The d12 moves under the robe with a slow, deliberate roll, finally resting on 5. The shopkeeper lifts their staff and taps the floor, sending a slight echo through the room. &quot;Ah, of course this would happen. It’s like the universe is begging for me to lose my patience.

<p>The d12 rolls with a slight clatter, settling with a soft thud on 4.

<p>Another momentary blip of exaggerated charade works that is suddenly subdued.</p>
<p>The d12 shifts languidly beneath the robe, like it’s too tired to care, settling on 2. The shopkeeper gives a brief shrug, almost indifferent. &quot;Let’s just move past that, shall we? There’s no need to keep this conversation on that. Not that big of a deal anyway.&quot; They glance at you with a hint of mild curiosity, as though they’re waiting for something better.</p>

Mr. Clean began the long walk down the docks where he came across one of the motor boats. To anyone else, it would look spic and span, but he has an eye for these things.</p>
<p>He reaches into his pocket pulling out a magic eraser which seemingly apparates into his hand, and he reaches behind his back where Mr. Clean branded lemon cleaner appears in his other hand. As he works his way around the boat, more cleaning supplies seem to appear and stack up around him. He is working carefully on each smooth surface and groove on the boat. Using the magic eraser on scuffs and removing dust and grime with his cleaner. Once he is finished with his job and he is satisfied most cleaning tools begin disappearing as you see him making final checks around the boat for spots he missed.</p>
<p>For a moment you see his face soften, looking in the water as a little bubbly whirlpool appears below him and then dissipates. He's still smiling, but you can tell he is missing something right now, possibly someone. It doesn't last for long though as he gets back to making the last checks on the boat before presumably taking it out.</p>

<p>&quot;Earth...&quot; Elissandra brings her brows together, deep in thought. &quot;That name sounds vaguely familiar, though I am not sure why... curious.

<p>He hums thinking for a moment.
&quot;It sounds nice, I would say the closest we have to magic in my world is the mascots from how others describe it.&quot;
&quot;Your society seems fairly advanced given you can describe the solar system, does your world rely solely on magic or a combination of magic and technology?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Magic and technology are the most precious assets on my world,&quot; Elissandra explains. &quot;Though, the fauna on Mahoukai can also harness magical powers as well. There are many extraordinary creatures to be found. What are these 'mascots' you speak of?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mascots are beings in my world, they are born from the companies who create them and the love people have for the product.&quot;
&quot;They can appear anywhere when they are born, it's quite random.&quot;
&quot;I first appeared in a woman's house shortly after my advertisement aired. She was frightened at first until I offered to help her clean the whole house, and she remembered who I was from the ad.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There are many other types of mascots in my world, humanoid, animal, even a few disembodied logos. I guess to those who don't have mascots it might seem quite strange.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;From who I have talked to here so far it seems as though mascots are not a common occurrence across other planets.&quot;</p>

<p>Lamb walks up the dock towards the man cleaning the boats. She pauses behind him then crouches down and cocks her head. &quot;Why do you clean?&quot;</p>
<p>This time cocking her head in the other direciton. &quot;You have lived long. Is that the joy of cleaning? I do not feel the need to see to your final moments. You still have long to live it seems.&quot; She then shakes her head and body like a dog covered in water. The pale fur rustling as she does so. &quot;Why do I feel this way? To see someone's death?

<p>He pauses and looks back up to her, a little shocked at how quiet she had been walking up, but offers her a big smile nevertheless.</p>
<p>&quot;And you are a quiet one friend.&quot;
&quot;Quite honestly, I clean because it is what I was born to do. I am lucky enough to enjoy it, the peace of seeing a world come to order with just a few swipes of my hand.&quot;</p>
<p>He pauses again, standing up wiping sweat from his brow.
&quot;In my world, people like me, if they have a good company and product tend to live a bit longer, so longevity is based on luck, good marketing, good products, and public favor. If you don't stay in the public eye, you tend to fade away.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm afraid on the death part, I do not quite understand, could you elaborate?&quot;</p>

<p>Still sat in the same pose crouched down the emotionless mask stares at Mr. Clean. &quot;Born to clean?&quot; She says wonderingly while Mr Clean is talking.</p>
<p>When he's done she  begins to speak. &quot;You are product?.. A person born through a merchants wares?...&quot; A moment of thought goes and the breeze picks up a little for that brief moment. &quot;You are not alive? Eternal, so long as not forgotten. No wonder I do not foresee death... Though I do not know why I wish to see.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is death what happens when there is nothing left to clean? If there is nothing to clean they have no use for you? And you are forgotten?&quot; Lamb sighs lightly before speaking her thoughts out loud and seemingly looking past Mr. Clean as if remembering. &quot;I see people at the end of their lives? Is that my role? What if there is no one left to meet? Do I fade like you? No.... I feel. I'm still watched, as I watch them. A vulture. I- I'm its last meal.&quot;</p>

<p>He looks at her and then looks on to nearby seabirds.</p>
<p>&quot;I am a byproduct of a product if we get into the technicalities.&quot;
&quot;Not every brand has a mascot you see, but my brand does, it became popular enough and useful to the public that I was brought to life...&quot;</p>
<p>He looks on wistfully.
&quot;When I was born I popped into a kind woman's house who really needed help cleaning, her name was Janet. A good friend, was about 1958 when I first popped in, and the first thing I remember is offering her Mr. Clean products and my help. We spent that whole day detailing her house.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Eventually they sent the mascot retrieval units to come get me, luckily I came along quietly and I had a good company who gave me more freedoms than most.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Janet became a good friend and I would stop by to help her clean, and we would talk even gossip a little... well maybe more than a little.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Reason I bring her up, is she was one of the first humans to believe I was sentient and deserving of rights. She was a good friend.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can die, all mascots can. Whether it be by fading away from being forgotten and discontinued or if the company decides to take you out. When I leave this world it will be like any of you. Everyone must go someday.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's a lot about me though, what about you? You say you are being watched? Do you need help? Is it someone here trying to hurt you?&quot;</p>

<p>Lamb stays erily still for a few seconds staring at the man in thought. &quot;You are a spirit. A spirit of merchants, destined to help. Help with cleaning. And help with friendships. A noble spirit. Janet is a friend to the spirits. Maybe she would know who I am.&quot; Lamb sounded a little sad when finishing the sentence.</p>
<p>Once again the breeze picks up a the still lamb remains crouched in front of Mr. Clean before quickly dying back down. &quot;Help? Maybe? This Vulture.... Isn't here. But I still feel eyes waiting for me to fall. But... Only when there is no one else to die will it touch me.&quot; She cocks her head, a sound of confusion rang through that sentence as if she didn't know why she said the things she said.</p>
<p>Another moment. &quot;Are all spirits of merchants chained worse than you?&quot;</p>

<p>He looks slightly concerned again and sighs.</p>
<p>&quot;Depends on the company.&quot;
&quot;Some have it as good as they can, like me. My company is great, I have a lovely partner and friends mascots and humans in the past.&quot;
&quot;Others are less than lucky. If they underperform or the company finds controversy a variety of things could happen, first and most common are mascots who fade.&quot;
&quot;This happens when a company stops selling the product and when the public starts to all forget about them.&quot;
&quot;Some have a quicker end for a variety of reasons, companies will... take them out by force. Some have gotten painfully creative with it in the past, yet sometimes it's simply a bullet.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Most companies get away with it since mascots are not human, and therefore lack most rights. In America where I am from we have advocated enough that some states have given us certain rights, but there is still a lot of contention on the subject in most places.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Some are unlucky enough to be the mascot of a product that will never get off the ground, the company hopes they can pull more than their weight and get the product out the door and when they expectedly fail, it's quite sad to see. These young mascots fade before our eyes. I wish there was more regulation behind the creation process, it's just not right.&quot;</p>
<p>He shakes his head and looks back at you.</p>
<p>&quot;You mentioned having a task here, one you cannot complete? What is it? Could I offer you some help?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;With my situation, I wouldn't call myself trapped at this point. Maybe bound by certain expectations, but I am at a point where it would not only be detrimental for me, but detrimental for the company if they tried to hurt me, kill me, or force me to do anything stupid.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Agreed, some die young, but I rather prevent it where I can.&quot;</p>
<p>He offers a hand to her, to help her board the boat. Steadying the craft firmly with his other arm by holding a post on the dock.</p>
<p>&quot;So you meet people in death, and yet these masters have brought you here to meet your own. This game is more twisted than I originally presumed, but there is not much we can do now other than enjoy the time we have left.&quot;</p>

<p>The holes in Lambs emotionless mask stare at the offering hand but refuses to take it. But it doesn't seem like refusal in a rude way. It seems her curiosity with the boat and what it may be started and ended with the single touch of her finger. &quot;You are human then? Bound by expectation from others yet beneficial and contributing to your world. <em>A valued item.</em> Yet loving like a parent. Wanting to raise young, and keep them safe from the dark of the night. So that they can play games like this during the day&quot; Lamb clearly doesn't seem to understand the situation both of them are in.</p>
<p>&quot;Brought to see my own death? Is it then there is no one left but those who are here who have to meet me? And once you all have..... Will the Vulture get its next meal?&quot; She says that final sentence wonderingly. But seemingly not afraid.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe... This Wolf I seem to care so much about has already met me yet I choose not to remember? Or he is lost like me. How do you find those who are lost dear cleaner?&quot;  She says curiously.</p>

<p>He hums retracting his hand slowly and setting his hand firmly on the transom. He removes his other hand from the dock as the water has calmed a bit anyway, but he looks her over again with a sad understanding.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not human, but I can understand why you would think that. I will say some of the values you mentioned do ring true with me, but time is running short for that I suspect.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think our situation here is a bit set in stone. If you have seen many deaths before, then maybe it won't hurt as much.&quot;
He breathes a moment thinking how to reply to the last part.
&quot;I think to be found, you have to be open, and right now it's a hell of a time to be doing that.&quot;</p>

<p>Lamb slowly nods &quot;Maybe you are right. I have not seen any deaths. But what I once has, has seen endless.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe being open is a choice only some have. Maybe I am like you. Made for one purpose. But I feel my cage is even more tightly bound. Maybe Wolf is lost forever?&quot;</p>
<p>Lamb looks out to the water and sees the setting sun. She then turns back to Mr. Clean. &quot;The night draws dear cleaner. As spirits we do not seem so fleeting. I do not see myself greeting you soon. Be well dear cleaner. I will see you another time.&quot; Once again she reaches out to the boat but this time stops before touching it.
She then stands up and walks off. Hooves almost silent against the wooden pier.</p>

<p>The Unnamed One sidles up to Mr. Clean, doing a really good job of looking as annoying as possible. He awkwardly tries to find something to lean on, fails, and decides instead to stand awkwardly with his hands in his pockets. The bravado falters a litte, interaction already not going according to plan, but The Unnamed One bulldozes his way through it.</p>
<p>&quot;I ca  see a fellow hero in you. It's nice to see that I'm not the only one trying to take care of these people.&quot; The Unnamed One waves his hand over the spotless boat. &quot;Even if it's in smaller ways, like this.&quot;</p>

<p>He looks up to you with a practiced smile, clearly looking over your form.
&quot;Hello friend, I wouldn't call myself a hero, I just clean up the messes as they come.&quot;
He pauses his ministrations and puts his supplies down for a moment, wiping the sweat off his brow and grabbing his coconut water and mango juice mixture to take a sip.
After finishing he places the cup down again.
&quot;Who might you be... hero?&quot;
He says that last part, possibly with a slight air of sarcasm, but depending on the listener it might go over their head.</p>

&quot;Sounds like you got a lot on you plate friend, the names Mr. Clean, but you can call me James if you want to drop the formalities.&quot;</p>
<p>He gets up sitting back on the bench in the back of the boat, offering you a seat ahead of him.
&quot;You have time to sit and chat?&quot;
He pats the seat in front of him, indicating for you to come aboard.</p>

<p>&quot;What about you, James? You seem to be quite level-headed all things considered.&quot; There's an edge of nervousness to TUO's voice now. Maybe it's Mr. Clean's calm demeanour but it seems like the persona is already faltering.</p>

<p>&quot;No. After leaving our ship, we did migrate to other labs to continue looking for a cure - having sentient zombies around sure helped with that - but it was burned to ashes by the black ops team sent to eliminate us in the end.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You wouldn't believe me if I told you. Or maybe you would, I don't know - but back where I'm from, Zombies have been a threat for centuries and what's left of civilization has adapted. Long enough that they've become the new normal, long enough that groups and corporations have formed around hunting them and protecting people from them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The largest of these - ZEI, standing for Zombie Exterminators Incorporated - sent their black ops to shut down our operation because they make money by protecting people from zombies.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's... kind of sick, honestly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And believe me, you're far from the first to have cursed them, and not just from those I'm personally close to. We even ended up getting swept into a city rebelling against them while on the run back home.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We liked playing old board games whenever we could find them. We often couldn't really do much else, not with electricity only really being a thing in the odd fortified human stronghold - most of them not really accessible to us due to the entire 'travelling with zombies, sentient or no' issue. Our favorite was probably chess - bunch of scientists we were at the end of the day. Ellis was always the best of it.&quot;</p>

&quot;But hey, <em>I</em> appreciate the help, dude. You're free to scrub this whole place top to bottom if it makes ya feel better, won't catch me complaining!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Victor, thanks for the praise and introduction. I can enjoy a few strokes to my ego.&quot;</p>
<p>He does a little half bow from his position squatting in the boat.
&quot;I find cleaning sometimes just calming, zen some might say.&quot;
&quot;It's something I know by heart and if I am ever lost it brings me back to myself. So while I'll always enjoy praise, I admit this is more for myself.&quot;</p>
<p>He leans forward, holding the dock with one hand to steady the boat and holding out the other to offer you a hand.
&quot;Care to join me, Victor?&quot;</p>

<p>Victor takes the man's hand and hoists himself into the boat.</p>
<p>&quot;I used to try and take guests on boat tours, but I was like, super bad at it, to tell the truth. Standing on the beach as a lifeguard is about as far as I go nowadays, haha.&quot;</p>

&quot;I must admit having a lifeguard before a game like this seems rather amusing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well of course we need a lifeguard!&quot; Victor chuckles himself in response. &quot;Just because we have to do some... unorthodox things sometimes doesn't make this place not a top-tier resort! We have <em>standards</em> and stuff! I mean you guys have it pretty good, most of our operating season this place is full of people... people who <em>pay</em> to be here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hmmm, a favorite place? Usually I just hang by the beach during my off-hours. A lotta my shift is spent like, cleaning spilt ice cream in toilet cubicles and stuff so I like to make the most of the sand when it's available. Come to think of it, maybe that's your idea of a good time, haha.&quot;</p>

Victor leans back against the side of the boat.
&quot;I suppose for some people, a holiday is less about <em>where you are</em> and more about <em>what you can do</em>, you know, if I were to get... philosophical.&quot;
He moves his eyebrows up and down and strokes his chin in mock contemplation as as says &quot;philosophical&quot;.
&quot;For some people, a holiday is the freedom to throw ice cream everywhere and know that someone who isn't them is going to have to clean it up.&quot;</p>

<p>He relaxes and goes back to smiling.
&quot;I gotta admit, you almost had me for a second! But you know, I been doin' this job for a good couple years now, and usually you can tell when someone is <em>really</em> about to lose it. Something in the breathing? In the hands? I dunno, I'm resort staff, not friggin' CSI: Miami&quot;</p>

<p>He gives you a wink and mock salute and turns back into the chair.
He pushes the throttle forward punching it and veering out of the dock.</p>
<p>He seems to go out a bit first and then begins to circle the island as it seems like the most interesting feature around. When searching for wild life, you both see streaks in the water up ahead, not sure what it could be he starts steering the boat closer.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not sure what that is up there, but I figure we should take a closer look!&quot;</p>

<p>He slows the boat down as they approach, eventually slowing to a stop.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh yeah, I like, always forget! Fish typically get spooked away from the island during public season, then they come back in the off months. You looking to do some fishing? Ordinarily it's not really something we let guests do, but uh, I can make a special exception for you guys.&quot;</p>

&quot;You are quite adept at reading people.&quot;</p>
<p>He settles back into his seat.
&quot;I hadn't thought of it that way before, but I do enjoy watching. People watching is part of the job with being a mascot. Being able to read people and guess what they need, what they want is part of the keys to survival for my kind.&quot;
&quot;I do enjoy watching things like this though, no worries, just peace.&quot;</p>

&quot;Won't be the first time he's caught me back here but I don't think he minds one bit. A little mischief is a lot more fun than ordering a drink I'd say!&quot;

<p>&quot;Electricity based magic is close enough, but to put it simply. That generator over there...&quot;
Pointing to the one, Vegael was sitting next to earlier.

&quot;Remarkable. If this is commonplace I'm almost scared to ask what other innovations are on your world. Why, if it were possible to reheat food in under a minute I'd be beside myself but that would just be plain silly.&quot;

<p>He hums in acknowledgment and turns.</p>
<p>&quot;Well I'd say it's out of our control, all we can do is our best to get through it and enjoy the time we have left.&quot;
&quot;I'm not looking forward to the game if that's what you are trying to ask, but I refuse to live my final days in self pity.&quot;</p>
<p>He finishes making the coffee, and let's the scent linger in his nose, leaning back onto the counter. Then cupping the mug gently with his hands and taking a swig.</p>
<p>A satisfied noise rumbles from his chest.</p>
<p>&quot;And what about you Mr. Hopkins?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Suppose you're right. Shopkeeper, the silly dice-headed fellow, told me much the same. Although he seems to believe we'll make it out of this but I'm no optimist so I'm in agreement with you. If these are to be our last days why not make the best of them with some unlikely friends.&quot;
He finishes his coffee and begins cleaning the glasses.
&quot;I wonder what the staff have in mind for us later. Best not to dwell on it I suppose.&quot;</p>

<p>He takes his last swallow and sets down his mug, starting to put away the machine and other necessities.
&quot;I imagine not much good is planned for us in certain regards, but I doubt we will be prepared for it anyways.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In the meantime, would you be interested in joining me for a walk? I saw a lovely trail up that way.&quot;</p>
<p>He points to a lush trail head further in on the island, trees at the front of it arc and there appear to be tropical flowers at the bases.</p>

<p>The d12 shifts languidly beneath the robe, like it’s too tired to care, settling on 2. The shopkeeper stretches, then slowly lifts their staff with no urgency. &quot;Well, well. A rare encounter, how lovely. I’m from Heroesburg, in case you haven’t guessed. Run my little shop, live a simple life… most days. Not that I’d call it ‘helping’... it’s more of a transaction thing.&quot; They let out a soft chuckle, nodding as if to say, &quot;That was almost interesting.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You remind me of some of my friends back home. I have heard snippets of your conversations with others, I can't say I will be the most interesting company, but I will do my best to keep you entertained.&quot;

<p>Shopkeeper's staff falls to the ground as they clutch their head with both hands in a classic &quot;OH GOD WHY&quot; fashion... and then he comes to an immediate still. He slowly and calmly picks up his staff and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB6YotDQ_ow">music begins to emanate from his dice-y person</a>.</p>
<p>The d12 shifts languidly beneath the robe, like it’s too tired to care, settling on 2. The shopkeeper barely moves, their posture drooping with the same lethargy. &quot;Let’s put that little tangent behind us. It’s really not worth lingering on.

<p>Shopkeeper smacks their head.</p>

<p>The d12 rolls with a bit more energy now, as if finding a little drive, and lands on 7. The shopkeeper taps their staff against the floor once, gently. &quot;That worked out better than I expected. You’ve earned a sliver of my respect. That’s a win, I guess.&quot; They let out a soft chuckle, nodding as if to say, &quot;That was almost interesting.&quot;</p>

<p>The d12 moves under the robe with a slow, deliberate roll, finally resting on 5. The shopkeeper stands tall, their staff raised in a moment of almost commanding presence. &quot;I’ll be honest, I didn’t think you’d pull it off. I’m... impressed. Somehow. Nice job, I guess. You’re welcome.&quot; They tilt their head slightly, considering what to say next, but don’t make a move.</p>

<p>He smacks his head again.</p>

<p>The d12 rolls with a bit more energy now, as if finding a little drive, and lands on 7. The shopkeeper gives a brief shrug, almost indifferent. &quot;I’ll be honest, I didn’t think you’d pull it off. I’m... impressed. Somehow. Keep it up, and I’ll almost start to like you.&quot; A brief flash of excitement dances through their motion as they stare fixated on you, ready for whatever comes next.</p>

<p>A fourth time.</p>

<p>The d12 rolls lazily under the robe, barely shifting before coming to a gentle stop on 1. The shopkeeper taps their staff on the floor with quiet authority. &quot;That worked out better than I expected. I’ll admit, that was impressive. But we both know this won’t last.&quot; They breathe out softly, a hint of impatience creeping into their tone as they wait for something to happen.</p>

<p>A fifth time.</p>

<p>The d12 rolls with a deliberate grace, coming to a smooth stop on 8. The shopkeeper leans forward, their posture suddenly more alert, and their staff twirls in their hand. &quot;Huh, okay. That actually worked. I’m... impressed. Somehow. This is a one-time thing though. Don’t get cocky.&quot; A small, tilt of their dice face stares as they evaluate you for a moment, awaiting a response.</p>

<p>Shopkeeper points to their face after this long winded, uh, &quot;communication&quot;.</p>

<p>He looks you over a bit, pondering. Some of this clearly flew over his head, but he decides to put his best foot forwards and continue.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm going to take that as 80's&quot;</p>
<p>Before your eyes he gives you a wink, and a spin and transforms into a cartoon form of himself from the 1980's. He hops up onto the doc and the world just around him shimmers a bit and you see his ad form.</p>




<p>At the end of his ad he gives you a bow, a wink and spins again returning to his original less cartoonish form.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope this gave you some form of entertainment my friend&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Clean began the long walk down the docks where he came across one of the motor boats. To anyone else, it would look spic and span, but he has an eye for these things.</p>
<p>He reaches into his pocket pulling out a magic eraser which seemingly apparates into his hand, and he reaches behind his back where Mr. Clean branded lemon cleaner appears in his other hand. As he works his way around the boat, more cleaning supplies seem to appear and stack up around him. He is working carefully on each smooth surface and groove on the boat. Using the magic eraser on scuffs and removing dust and grime with his cleaner. Once he is finished with his job and he is satisfied most cleaning tools begin disappearing as you see him making final checks around the boat for spots he missed.</p>
<p>For a moment you see his face soften, looking in the water as a little bubbly whirlpool appears below him and then dissipates. He's still smiling, but you can tell he is missing something right now, possibly someone. It doesn't last for long though as he gets back to making the last checks on the boat before presumably taking it out.</p>

&quot;Not my boat friend, and not much of a sailor myself, but I figured given the circumstances seems like my time to learn is running out. Rather spend the time I have left enjoying life rather than dreading the end of it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You actually remind me of a friend of mine, but he's more of a caricature of you than anything.&quot;

Ferg trade 3 basket berry for axe, and one basket poison leaf for small fur. Ferg still not sure why want posion leaf; it poison, no good to eat. What else to use for??

&quot;I driven one of these bad boys once before in the 1970's with some pals of mine, but I'll admit it has been a good 40-50 years since then, difficult to remember these days. I'd be happy to take you out on this boat for a spin if you are interested.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ever seen anything like this?&quot; The man asks, motioning around as he steps up.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, 'cause I sure haven't. Name's Marshal. Based on the look, I'm guessing you're from a shithole like me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You can call me Korya,&quot; Sariya replies.</p>
<p>&quot;This is also new to me. My homeland is far from any sea and I can't remember the last time I saw a sky this clear.&quot; A look of melancholy crosses her face.</p>
<p>&quot;If only we were here under better circumstances.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, nice to meet you Korya. Sorta. Spot on about circumstances. Pick whatever you prefer between MM or Marshal for me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ahh, you're tellin' me. I can hardly remember if the sea even exists back home.&quot; He takes a seat nearby, looking up into the sky. &quot;But hey, I'll enjoy the sight while I can. Might as well take a recording or two as a memento.&quot;</p>
<p>He sits in silence for a moment, finicking with something. &quot;Right? Talk about two situations that don't even mix. I get the first vacation in my life in some nice place, and boom, hey, you gotta kill everyone too! I'd ask for a refund, but I guess it's free.&quot;</p>

<p>“I get what you mean.”</p>
<p>Sariya glances out at the sea, a look of sadness crossing her face.</p>
<p>“Life is never fair. We can only make do with what it throws at us.”</p>

<p>She pauses for a few minutes.</p>
<p>“Say Marshal, you said your world isn’t a kind one. I assume you’ve also had to make difficult choices. Do you ever feel like you’ve gone down the wrong path in life?”</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, sounds like every day of my life, making do with what we got. Minus the killing others part.&quot;</p>
<p>He maintains silence for a moment, raising a leg and resting an arm on it as he looks out towards the sea.</p>
<p>&quot;Hard to say, right? We go down the paths in life that keep us alive. Even the hard choices do. If I make a choice I regret, at least I'm alive to regret it. I just try to believe in my own importance to those I'm still with.&quot;</p>

<p>The d12 rolls lazily under the robe, barely shifting before coming to a gentle stop on 1. The shopkeeper lifts their staff and taps the floor, sending a slight echo through the room. &quot;Well, well. A rare encounter, how lovely. Heroesburg is where I usually hang my robe. It’s home base, but I like to pop out now and then. But, it’s a lot more calm than this place, that's for sure.&quot; They sigh deeply, giving a short nod, clearly finding this interaction a bit more engaging.</p>

<p>The d12 spins beneath the robe with a subtle force, landing on 11. The shopkeeper stands tall, their staff raised in a moment of almost commanding presence. &quot;Shopkeeper...

I suppose we can explore this, just don’t get too carried away.&quot; They adjust their robe with a casual flick of the wrist, awaiting your next move.</p>

<p>The d12 shifts languidly beneath the robe, like it’s too tired to care, settling on 2.

<p>Once the crowed began to accept the situation and move on Lamb made her way to the the shoreline for a moment, seemingly lost she tilts her head to the right. &quot;A shore..... I've stood here many times, waiting for those who never made it back. But why? Why was I waiting?.......&quot;</p>
<p>Now staring at the ground for a moment she goes on. &quot;I-...... I was waiting for theirs deaths....&quot; A longer pause as if in disbelief. The wooden looking mask remaining emotionless. A light breeze catching her pale fur making it shimmer. &quot;Before I took the plunge to see them go. They hated me.... Why? I- Had to see them go...&quot;</p>
<p>Raising her pale fur coated hands to the holes in the mask she cocks her head again, this time in the other direction. &quot;I remember. I did not look like this. I was something different. Now I feel.....&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;less than whole.....&quot;</p>

<p>Lamb cocks her head in the other direction. &quot;Are you masked child? Much like me?&quot; She lightly touches the mask on her face before letting her hand fall again. &quot;Is my timing right as I have been fated to meet you? You are so far from death I feel. So much life still present. My timing should only be right once you are so close to death&quot;</p>
<p>She then shakes her head and looks up at the sky for a second before looking back at the dice and continuing in a flat tone &quot;Why am I tasked to meet you at your death? You are not dying yet I know that is why I will do&quot;</p>

She cocks her head. &quot;You are not...&quot; pausing for a moment she continues slowly as she finishes what she was saying. &quot;<em>wolf?</em>&quot; Vigorously shaking her head as if to snap back to reality she goes on. &quot;Why Wolf?

Looking back to Ferg the blank mask stares at him for a moment. &quot;You are a man? Or are you like me?.. But I do not know what I am.......&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Strange place. Certainly not like anything I've ever seen before, outside of old movie posters anyway... wait, if we're supposed to fight to the death - aren't I already a zombie? I suppose I can die again...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There... wasn't one, really. This was the work of a virus that turns people into a zombie after they die. The virus is necromantic in <em>nature,</em> sure, but that's about it.&quot;</p>
<p>Shunny thinks for a moment before tilting his head.</p>
<p>&quot;I suppose there's that famous tale of where the virus began - the most well known story of how the pandemic started was with an old baron who turned to combining necromancy and science to resurrect his dead wife, accidentally creating zombies in the process. I... admit it all sounds rather ridiculous to me, though, but if it <em>is</em> true I suppose the answer would be him...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well that's rude. How about I ask you why you're white next time.&quot;</p>
<p>Shunny shakes his head for a moment and sighs before sitting down to look back at the ocean.</p>
<p>&quot;If you must know, I'm a zombie. Have been for as long as I can remember. I'm surprised you even need to ask, I know I'm not exactly a... normal zed, but they're still everywhere.&quot;</p>

<p>The d12 rolls with a deliberate grace, coming to a smooth stop on 8.

<p>A froggish individual walks out onto the warm sands. He wears a pair of denim overalls and generally looks a bit like a big baby, his eyes wide. Well, his eyes already appear to be rather wide, presumably because he is a frog, but there is a distinct look of surprise and terror on his face as well. He looks at the people surrounding him and lets out an involuntary little croak.</p>

<p>The d12 spins beneath the robe with a subtle force, landing on 11.

<p>A young woman in a flowing blue and silver dress stands on the shoreline, arms crossed, wearing an expression of confusion and irritation. She scans her surroundings a bit before commenting to no one in particular, &quot;What a beautiful realm! Tis a shame this place will be tarnished by senseless bloodshed...&quot; Her voice trails off as she crouches and runs her fingertips through the crystal clear island water. Suddenly, Queen Elissandra throws her head back and laughs, &quot;HA! And to think I was foolish enough to believe I was merely whisked away on a free holiday, fitting of royalty!&quot;</p>

<p>While walking away from the bar and trying to put the image of certain guests (Shopkeeper, Cendre, Matilda, etc.) out of his mind, Jim's eyes latch onto a beautiful woman in front of him...</p>
<p>He blinks once. He blinks twice. Rubbing his eyes, she's still there. SHE'S REAL.
Jim says &quot;Hi, I'm Jon. Is that dress real- Wait hold on, scratch that. You're very beautiful. Would you like to take a walk on the beach with me?&quot;</p>
<p>Jon extends a hand out to her majesty. His dumb smile shows some surprise at managing to get out a complete sentence. He still hasn't realized he said his own name wrong.</p>

<p>&quot;Well ma'am, I happen to come from a far off realm of my own called... 'Florida'.&quot;
Victor pronounces the name of the place with mock(?) reverence.</p>
<p>&quot;You see, the people there didn't understand my renegade way of life. I figured I must have had a higher calling, because one day I saw an ad- I mean, a mysterious letter arrived for me, inquiring about my services. Originally I was only a 'temp', but over time I have become a core servant of this island, due to the uh... like, vast wealth and enriching employment it has given me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;(And the fact that my old housemate can't track me here, and make me give him the money I owe him for totalling his car)&quot; Victor adds under his breath.</p>

<p>&quot;If you look at the upsides of it,&quot; Vegael said. &quot;We truly are on our own. I suppose you should take the time you have to try to... relax? You are a princess, right?&quot;</p>
<p>Vegael's attention had been caught by the young woman's exclamations.</p>

<p>&quot;I am young, but I am a Queen,&quot; Elissandra responds, gazing wistfully out at the horizon. &quot;I what you mean, though, about being on our own, having time to contemplate things... I do not usually get such time at home.&quot; Elissandra takes a closer look at Vegael's unusual appearance and raises an eyebrow. &quot;And what might be your name? That's quite an interesting ensemble you wear.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A Queen at such an age? Quite impressive. But I hope being at this retreat, as involuntary as it is for us all, isn't too much an inconvenience.&quot;</p>
<p>Vegael offered a hand, and said, &quot;My name is Vegael. My clothing? It is a flight suit, I used to be able to fly. What might your name be?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I <em>was</em> capable of flight,&quot; Vegael corrected. When she broke off the handshake, she spread one arm out, to show that her 'wings' were her hoodie's long, hanging sleeves. The last one-third of her 'wing' had been severed, and the end crimped together in a seemingly hasty manner.</p>
<p>&quot;My wings were snipped, so I cannot fly anymore. Regardless, it is nice to meet you, Queen Elissandra.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The skies are indeed beautiful, and so is looking down at the planet from a distance. I plan to return one day. Someday.&quot;

<p>Jim stumbles out of his bungalow. Eyes focusing, he realizes there are other guests milling about. &quot;Were their mini-fridges not working either? Gotta remember to complain about that&quot; Jim mutters. Jim then spots Bramblewood polishing glasses for the umpteenth time at the tiki bar, and starts waddling in that direction, making sure to avoid eye contact with the scarier folk.</p>
<p>Jim takes a seat at the tiki bar and Bramblewood looks over, acknowledging Jim's... large presence. Lifting a gloved finger, Jim opens his mouth. &quot;One beer, please,&quot; is what comes out. Not an unfortunate outcome, all things considered.</p>
<p>Several drinks later, Jim is hammered, resting his head on the bar, still clutching the drink in his hand. He stares off wordlessly at the ocean. Thoughts of complaining about room service are replaced with how good this beer is. If no one bothers Jim, he might nod off in this blissful situation.</p>

<p>Jim cracks a smile, &quot;You know it!&quot;</p>
<p>Jim tries to get a good look at the tall man to his right but the sun is glinting off his bald head in such a way. Jim can't see from this angle, refuses to sit up, and just looks back at his drink.</p>
<p>&quot;What a dingy place, you know? Jeez, you'd think they'd've... I don't know, run a cable to our rooms so we could watch some TV, but get this! Even the fridges aren't working. I don't know if it was plugged in or not, but something's gotta be done about this. Am I right?&quot; Jim says, waiting to hear some validation, but purposefully looking away from Mr. Clean's shiny head.</p>

<p>He looks you over again, thanking Mr. Bramblewood for his drink, happy to find it has a little pink umbrella balanced on one side.
&quot;I'm never one to blame the staff, but I can see why you are frustrated given the other details of our current situation.&quot;
&quot;All we can do is make the best of it, and hey as far as I can tell so far the drinks are free.&quot;
He takes a swig of his drink, delicately moving the umbrella to the other side of the glass.</p>
<p>&quot;So what's your story friend?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well you must be a real nice guy, pal. I can't stand it personally. Not being able to store cold drinks in our rooms truly is the worst of our current situation. It just kills me.&quot;</p>
<p>Jim sits up and tries to ignore that Mr. Clean seems a foot taller that him and is incredibly buff. He takes another sip of his drink, seeing that it's running low.</p>
<p>&quot;Barkeep, can we get a few appetizers here?&quot; Jonathan Bramblewood</p>

<p>He glances over.
&quot;I show anger sometimes, I just choose to save it for what I deem to be truly necessary.&quot;
He takes another sip of his drink, and then swirls the glass to mix the fluids inside more.
Taking a glance over to the volleyball court with an appraising stare</p>
<p>&quot;Not sure if they have appetizers here, but if this falls through we could always migrate to the kitchen.&quot;</p>

<p>Jim's jaw drops for a moment. He's aghast that the tall man actually took him up on the offer to leave the bar.</p>
<p>To everyone's surprise, Jim pushes away the drink handed to him. Gritting his teeth, he pushes his body off the barstool. Look who's still got it!</p>
<p>Feeling empowered by his successful physical exertion, he scrambles to catch up with Mr. Clean. Jim puffs his chest out while he strides confidently alongside the buff bald man. Knowing he can only keep up this style of walking for another 30 seconds at most, Jim asks between breaths &quot;So where's this kitchen anyhows?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, well, I could go for some crackers and cheese. I <em>huff</em> don't know <em>huff</em> what a big guy like <em>huff</em> you would eat, but <em>huff</em> let's just eat whatever's there.&quot;</p>

<p>He grabs his arm and holds him steady as they continue to walk, slowing his pace to match Jim's.

<p>Jim takes the opportunity to close his eyes and run his hand slowly through his hair, massaging a small headache. Some kind of armchair seems to have appeared to support his left side, which he takes advantage, putting his entire weight into Mr. Clean's side.
Jim allows himself to be dragged to the kitchen and set down on a wooden chair inside. Still clutching his head, he opens his eyes and sees Mr. Clean rummaging through the pantry next to the fridge.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey! they do have working fridges here. This place ain't a total dump, huh.&quot;</p>
<p>He notices the plastic water bottle left on the table next to him and takes a gulp of fresh water. Disgusting, but it washes out the taste of alcohol.</p>

<p>He finishes rummaging through the pantry and grabs a box of Ritz crackers. Turning to the fridge, he grabs a block of cheddar cheese.
He grabs two plates, a cutting board, and a knife and comes back over.
He opens one sleeve tipping it over the plate and letting some crackers tumble out and opens the cheese and begins cutting some slices and passing them your way.
He looks over for a moment with a slight inquisitive look on his face as if studying you and then back to cutting cheese.</p>
<p>&quot;If you don't mind me asking, what's your spirit of choice?&quot;</p>

<p>Jim has started to pack crackers into the inner pockets of his coat at this point, eating every third cracker.</p>
<p>&quot;You gonna eat any of this? Or will you make something more substantial for yourself? What does a bodybuilder eat, anyway?&quot;</p>

<p>He can't help but laugh a little.
&quot;So I take it it's less for the taste and more for the feeling.&quot;
&quot;I can remember the first drink I had, it was back in '61, sales were up and the head of the company called me into his office and I was given a neat whiskey. Have to admit I was a bit unprepared and it sent me into a coughing fit.&quot;
&quot;These days I'm more of a rum guy and lean more towards mixed fruity drinks. Though an old fashioned with lemon occasionally hits the spot.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You remember your first time?&quot;</p>
<p>He looks over finished slicing the cheese putting some on his plate and passing the rest your way.
He puts a slice on a cracker and starts munching away while listening to your response.</p>

<p>Jim stares blankly until Mr. Clean stops talking. He realizes he needs to say something, but doesn't remember what his friend just asked.</p>
<p>Gathering his wits, he starts, &quot;Well, I guess you're more of an expert than me. I don't care to LEARN what the drinks are called. People just get my vibe and see that I want something strong. Though I gotta agree, an old fashioned is just what you need sometimes.&quot;</p>

&quot;AUGH, you bitch! I mean, uh, that's not cool man! I thought you had replaced the electrolytes with alcohol or something. You were spending so long back there, but this is just normal gatorade!. That was a nasty trick.&quot;</p>

That cloak is definitely a weird outfit. Doesn't make any sense in this heat. No sense at all. Nope. Jim's dream theory seems to be going out the window.</p>
<p>He takes another sip of grog. &quot;Maybe if I ignore it, it'll go away&quot; he thinks out loud, not realizing he verbalized that particular thought. Jim turns around and focuses on the other guests coming out of their bungalows, determined to ignore the dice creature beside him.</p>

<p>&quot;That wasn't real, right? I mean, I can't even see him anymore.&quot;</p>

<p>At the other end of the small bar at the tiki hut you see a larger man, he turns and waves as you sit.
&quot;I overheard you haven't drank much before, if I could give a suggestion I would say order a Blue Wave. It has hints of a variety of citrus, coconut, pineapple and uses rum for the base. It also looks quite neat in the glass.&quot;
He swirls his own glass where it appears he is drinking that very drink, it has a nice blue hue with a cherry on top.</p>

<p>Marshal offers a wave in return. He's got a light tinge of red on his face.
&quot;Damn, you're spotless. Seems like expertise we could use back home.&quot; He laughs, finishing the rest of his first drink.</p>
<p>&quot;I dig this stuff.&quot; He says, gently placing the glass down on the bar. &quot;Thanks for the recommendation.&quot; Marshal puts in his next order, a Blue Wave. &quot;First time I ate anything like 'real food', it was something sweet. Apparently fruity, if the flavors I read about were accurate. Stuff might as well be nostalgia in a cup.&quot;</p>

<p>He smiles.
&quot;Glad to hear you like it, it's a favorite of mine.&quot; He swirls the glass and keeps sipping, he finishes the glass orders another and once received he continues swirling it around.</p>
<p>&quot;The names Mr. Clean, James if you want to drop the formalities, and your name is?&quot;</p>

<p>He takes an immediate sip as the order arrives. &quot;Ahhh,&quot; he exhales slowly. &quot;That's nice.&quot;</p>

<p>He takes a drink, closing his eyes and nodding. &quot;You got it.&quot;</p>
<p>He smiles, opening his eyes. &quot;Ahah. Not many people <em>to</em> kill or spy on, really. I guess I'd technically qualify more for soldier, but I think of myself as more like a glorified garbage collector.&quot; He lightly swishes the glass back and forth before taking another sip.</p>
<p>&quot;Ain't got much of a job description. You could best describe it as the collection of usable or precious materials to return home.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well if you are willing to take the trash out I'd say you are another man set on cleaning the world. I respect that.&quot;
He raises his glass to you in a toast and smirks.
&quot;To taking the trash out!&quot;
Once the glasses clink, he downs his second glass and politely orders another from Mr. Bramblewood.</p>
<p>He looks up again for a moment and considers your last statement again.
&quot;Though I wouldn't call usable or precious materials trash, what do you mean by that friend?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To takin' the trash out!&quot; He says, clinking the glass.</p>
<p>A sort of wry smile appears on his face. &quot;Well, you'd definitely be right there. I say 'trash' 'cause it was left behind. Lots of people, on the planet or far out there, decided on taking a bit of a... well, let's call it a mass exodus. Or multiple of 'em. Massive cities and structures, abandoned just like that.&quot;</p>
<p>He looks into his drink, running a gloved finger on the rim. &quot;But hey, I'm sure you've heard the saying 'one man's trash is another man's treasure!'. That kinda applies to those who got left behind.&quot;</p>

<p>He looks a bit more somber.
&quot;There's always someone who has to ruin it for everyone else, I guess on your world that's the people who left you all behind.&quot;
&quot;Was there any rhyme or reason behind it, or just those who could afford to fled?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hahaha.&quot; He lets out a dry laugh. &quot;Hard to say. If the situation on some of those stations reflected what happened, I guess I don't blame people for haulin' tail outta there. In some places, you could tell it was clearly planned--in others, more of a rush job depending on what's left.&quot;</p>
<p>He takes another drink, keeping it in his hand. &quot;Least, that's what I could deduce. Any logs that got left were far and few between. Selfish, or survival? S'ashame. Wasn't hoping to get thrust into a situation like that. Thought I could keep it simple a bit longer.&quot;</p>

&quot;Hard to read people sometimes, I can't imagine trying to do so with just what they left behind.&quot;

<p>&quot;Yeah, we don't exactly get the most to go off of. As for how many were left, well... I never really saw a corpse that was fresh, if that helps. Saw maybe one guy barely alive in the cryogenics section of a structure before. Clearly got abandoned.&quot;</p>
<p>He sets his drink down and stretches. &quot;Between you and me, I only ever see two other people during most of my days. I'm sure larger communities exist, but we can make a decent enough living for ourselves.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not much choice. It'd all be too boring otherwise. It's a good principle to have, though!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ya know, good question. I guess entertainment depends on the haul. Might delay or hold a shipment just to check some stuff out, admittedly. We might get a movie, book, that kind of thing from time to time. Some games we don't really got enough players for, though.&quot; He lets out a dry chuckle.</p>

<p>He muses for a moment.
&quot;You know, if you are feeling a bit silly. I got a commerical I think that will be pretty entertaining. It was made for one of the largest events in my world, it's called the Super Bowl.&quot;
&quot;If you would like I would be more than happy to perform for you, just remember it's on the silly side.&quot;</p>

<p>He downs his drink, setting it down with a small thunk on the bar.
He looks your way with a twinkle in his eye.
With that, he hops up, gives a wink and a twirl, and appears in his most recent cartoon form full out of the swim trunks and slides and back into his white trousers and flat bottom shoes.</p>


<p>He hops up from his seat taking a few steps back from the bar and takes a deep breath snapping his fingers.</p>


<p>He then proceeds to perform his 2017 Super Bowl advertisement for you, making a show out of it.</p>


<p>He finishes with a huff, wiping his brow.
He gives a bit of a bow and then twirls around back into his beach clothes and takes a seat back down at the bar.</p>
<p>He puts a finger up.
&quot;Mr. Bramblewood, could I have another Blue wave please?&quot;
Once he has his drink he settles back in his seat with a smirk.</p>
<p>&quot;That was one of the better-received ads I ever took part in. Hope you found it enjoyable.&quot;
He has the smile of a satisfied showman and sips his drink, once again swirling it around in the glass as he finishes.</p>

<p>&quot;But hey,&quot; he says, looking back towards you, &quot;the great plain? Tell me about it! Sounds like a dreamscape. Maybe.&quot;</p>

<p>The d12 shifts beneath the robe with a rhythmic roll, landing squarely on 6. The shopkeeper straightens, their posture almost regal as they steady their staff. &quot;You’ve got me thinking now, and I don’t usually think. Normally, I wouldn’t care at all, but I’m curious for some reason. Let’s get this over with quickly, yeah?&quot; They breathe out softly, a hint of impatience creeping into their tone as they wait for something to happen.</p>

<p>The d12 moves under the robe with a slow, deliberate roll, finally resting on 5. The shopkeeper taps their staff against the floor once, gently. &quot;Well, that didn’t meet expectations. I mean, I guess I’ve dealt with worse, but still. We all have those days, right?&quot; A brief flash of excitement dances through their motion as they stare fixated on you, ready for whatever comes next.</p>

<p>He shrugs. &quot;Expectations can be a real killer. Don't let it get to ya.&quot;</p>
<p>He looks back towards the bar again, waiting for his drink. His eyes remain fixated.</p>
<p>&quot;Guess it isn't the first time I've met something with a rotating head on a mission. First time one could talk, though--least that I let.&quot; He speaks casually, almost as if he couldn't be bothered with any emotional inflection in his words.</p>
<p>&quot;In any case, why get it over with quickly? We got all day, don't we?&quot; He questions, resting his chin on his fist.</p>

<p>The d12 spins beneath the robe with a subtle force, landing on 11. The shopkeeper brushes a stray thread from their sleeve, as though fixing a minor imperfection. &quot;Well, that was easy enough. Look at that, we’re both on the same side. I’m genuinely surprised, but okay.&quot; A yawn escapes, and they idly adjust the hem of their robe, showing no particular interest.</p>

<p>&quot;Hah!&quot; He lets out a small laugh. &quot;It'd be a welcome change,&quot; he says, finally receiving his drink. Some form of slushy, bright cocktail. He briefly smells it before giving it a sip.</p>
<p>An eyebrow raises, and stays raised for a few moments. As he lets the taste settle, he finally swallows the drink. &quot;Oh. That's kinda weird. Not bad, but...&quot; He thinks.</p>
<p>He snaps a finger. &quot;Oooh, right! Not used to things having so much... flavor.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You wanna pull up a seat?&quot; He asks, moving the bar stool next to him back with a leg. &quot;Got plenty of time. What's life like back where... wherever you came from?&quot;</p>

<p>The d12 rolls with a slight clatter, settling with a soft thud on 4. The shopkeeper stretches, then slowly lifts their staff with no urgency. &quot;That’s a bit of a shocker.

<p>The Unnamed One saunters over to the Tiki bar and dramatically sighs as he leans back on it, a very punchable smirk forming on his lips. He adjusts his fedora and tips it to anyone who walks by, but is very understandably ignored. He continues trying this tactic for a few minutes, smirk sliding off his face slowly, before he starts clearing his throat. Quietly at first, but becoming progressively louder as whatever attention he is looking for is clearly not being provided.</p>
<p>The smirk reappears, perhaps a bit forced this time, and he quietly says, &quot;Hmph, have it your way, you tsunderes.&quot; He then unsheathes and swings his katana through the air, as if practicing a mock battle. It is painfully obvious to anyone with even a modicum of fighting experience that The Unnamed One has no idea what he's doing. After a few awkward swings that come a little close to Jonathan a few times, The Unnamed One stops and resheathes the katana, imaginary foe seemingly vanquished. He leans on the bar some more and pushes his glasses up the bridge of his nose, but they do not glint in the light because that would be stupid.</p>

<p>Victor watches The Unnamed One's mock battle with a bemused look on his face. After studying him for a moment, he comes over.
&quot;What fantastic swordsmanship, sir! But I can assure you no harm will befall you yet! So you may uh...&quot; he lowers his voice somewhat and leans in as much as he can without having to fully breathe in The Unnamed One's... aura &quot;...but the katana away before you hurt someone... like my boss... please.&quot;</p>
<p>He stops leaning in and goes to stick out his hand for a handshake, but decides against it at the last moment.
&quot;I'm Victor, by the way. I work here. Let me know if there's anything I can do to make your stay more comfortable.&quot;

<p>His mannerism are indeed unnamed, much like the rest of him. You can tell because of his name, or lack thereof. TUO's chest swells at the 'compliment'.</p>

<p>Shopkeeper stares in stunned silence for several seconds before crumpling to his knees and smacking his head into the ground repeatedly.</p>
<p>After about a minute of this, he slowly stands up.</p>

<p>The d12 clinks and clacks with a groan before settling heavily on 3. The shopkeeper stands straighter, though it's obvious they're holding back a yawn. &quot;Huh, just what I expected. More disappointment. Honestly, I’m not surprised, but I thought you’d at least try. I’m sure you’ll turn it around, eventually.&quot; They give you a long, exaggerated stare, as if you’ve told them the worst joke ever.</p>

<p>The d12 rolls with a sharp, almost thunderous impact, landing on 12. The shopkeeper slouches dramatically, raising their staff as if it's the last thing they want to do. &quot;Perfect timing, as always. It’s like the universe is dedicated to making my life more miserable. But sure, keep looking at me like I’m the one who messed it up.&quot; They shake their head twice, staring you down as if expecting you to offer something impressive.</p>

<p>The d12 rolls under the robe like it's a sickly animal, its movements painfully slow, landing on 2. The shopkeeper snaps their staff down with a nonchalant flick, barely paying attention. &quot;Well, that was about as disappointing as finding out your lunch is just bread. Honestly, I’m not surprised, but I thought you’d at least try. It’s fine. I’ll just go cry into my empty expectations.&quot; They slowly tilt their head, tapping their foot in impatience, as though expecting something better.</p>

<p>The d12 rolls with a sharp, almost thunderous impact, landing on 12. The shopkeeper stands straighter, though it's obvious they're holding back a yawn. &quot;That was almost impressive… if you were a toddler with zero coordination. I’d say ‘better luck next time,’ but I’m honestly not sure you’re capable of that. Your efforts are honestly inspiring… in a ‘how not to do things’ kind of way.&quot; They scoff, muttering under their breath as they tap their staff in irritation.</p>

<p>The d12 rolls with a sharp, almost thunderous impact, landing on 12. The shopkeeper snaps their staff down with a nonchalant flick, barely paying attention. &quot;Wow, that was just... tragically predictable. Honestly, I’m not surprised, but I thought you’d at least try. Can’t wait to see what you ruin next.&quot; They give you a long, exaggerated stare, as if you’ve told them the worst joke ever.</p>

<p>The d12 rolls with a sudden jolt, almost too fast, landing on 7. The shopkeeper flicks their staff with a flourish, though it’s more a gesture of disdain than style. &quot;Oh, sure, I totally thought that would work out perfectly. I guess you have a real talent for letting everyone down. Can’t wait to see what you ruin next.&quot; They sigh loudly, throwing a hand up as if begging the universe for something exciting to happen.</p>

<p>The d12 rolls more smoothly now, with a sense of boredom, landing on 8. The shopkeeper stands straighter, though it's obvious they're holding back a yawn. &quot;Oh, really? That’s how you’re going to handle it? It’s like watching a train wreck in slow motion. I’m sure you’ll somehow mess it up again, just wait.&quot; They glare at you with a subtle but unmistakable mockery, as if you’re not even worth their time.</p>

<p>The d12 rolls under the robe like it's been jolted awake, landing roughly on 5. The shopkeeper stands straighter, though it's obvious they're holding back a yawn. &quot;I definitely didn’t think that one through. Well, this one’s going to be a classic. At least it was memorable, right?&quot; They slowly tilt their head, tapping their foot in impatience, as though expecting something better.</p>

<p>The d12 rolls sluggishly, like it's dragged out of bed, barely managing to land on 1. The shopkeeper stands tall, their staff raised like a scepter, exuding an over-the-top sense of power. &quot;Wow, that was almost as bad as I thought it would be. I really thought it couldn’t get worse, but here we are. I should’ve known better than to hope for anything good.&quot; They give you a long, exaggerated stare, as if you’ve told them the worst joke ever.</p>

<p>The d12 shifts with a surge of energy, landing with an exaggerated thud on 11. The shopkeeper adjusts their robe with a mock sense of urgency. &quot;You know, I’d say I’m calm... but I’m really not. Let’s just say I’m about two seconds away from blowing up. But sure, keep pushing my buttons. It’s so much fun.&quot; They sigh loudly, throwing a hand up as if begging the universe for something exciting to happen.</p>

<p>After minutes of this incessant, unstoppable ridiculousness, they go still.</p>

<p>Shopkeeper barely moves as TUO talks. There's a lost vigor their, as if whichever force compelled them is muted or even lost. A shaky, tired hand attempts to flick their dice head one more time, but collapses to their side instead.</p>

<p>The Unnamed One deflates, this time fully. What seems to be genuine concern flashes through his eyes as he leans a little closer to the Shopkeeper. &quot;Are you having a sugar crash or something? Happens to me all the time with Red Bull.&quot; Peter Williams rustles around his pockets for a bit, pulling out some old receits first before finally managing to produce a small chocolate bar. A 'Mars Bar' if the label on it is to be trusted.</p>
<p>&quot;Here you can have this.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Blink.&quot; he says, as he has no eyes to blink.</p>
<p>He takes the bar, brings it to his face, and it starts to disappear one bite at a time, wrapper and all.</p>
<p>The d12 rolls aggressively, landing with a solid impact on 10. The shopkeeper flicks their staff lazily, clearly uninterested. &quot;Oh good, you’ve made me curious now. Well done. Honestly, I could not care less. Alright, hit me with the most thrilling thing you’ve got.&quot; They slowly tilt their head, tapping their foot in impatience, as though expecting something better.</p>

<p>It's clear The Unnamed One is starting to feel like the straight man in this conversation, something he is decidedly not used to. &quot;You're not supposed to eat the wrapper...&quot; He manages weakly.</p>
<p>Seeing the Shopkeep waiting expectantly for an answer, The Unnamed One visibly shakes his head in an attempt to break his stupour and does his best to reapply his smug smirk to his face. &quot;I have defeated many a foe in my home world, each more fearsome than the last. What about you, dice man?&quot;</p>

<p>Shopkeeper falls to the ground, planting himself on his ass with a quiet <em>thump</em>. He's still and defeated for about another minute before rising back to his feet. It's a bit obvious the slow motion of him standing matches the last time he got up. Which makes sense as he jumps right back into...</p>
<p>The d12 shifts with a surge of energy, landing with an exaggerated thud on 11. The shopkeeper flicks their staff with a flourish, though it’s more a gesture of disdain than style. &quot;You ever make a decision so bad, you can feel it in your bones? Nothing says ‘good decision’ like this catastrophe. At least it was memorable, right?&quot; They sigh loudly, throwing a hand up as if begging the universe for something exciting to happen.</p>

<p>The d12 shifts beneath the robe with a rhythmic roll, landing squarely on 6. The shopkeeper gives an absent-minded flick of their staff, looking unbothered. &quot;Let’s leave that behind and focus on something else. Honestly, it’s probably for the best. I’ll spare you the details.&quot; They adjust their robe with a casual flick of the wrist, awaiting your next move.</p>

<h1>Day 1 Victor Event</h1>
<p>&quot;Yo, hope you're all still having a good time, dudes!&quot;
You suddenly notice Victor approaching, waving around at anyone on the beach, while walking towards the closed-off gift shop. You aren't sure exactly how long he'e been gone for, but he's managed to procure sunglasses, and is carrying a clipboard tucked under his right arm.
&quot;Glad to see none of you killed each other yet! It happens sometimes, you know. With the less chill guests. Guess it makes this bit somewhat easier though!&quot;</p>
<p>He deftly whips out the clipboard and produces a pen from seemingly nowhere. As he continues to talk, he begins to idilly click the pen repeatedly.</p>
<p>&quot;Right, so I got a few questions for y'all, you don't gotta answer if you don't wanna, but hey a little activity participation never hurt anyone huh?&quot;
He beams a smile that should feel genuine, but between the fresh shades and the circumstances of your being here, it might come off a tad sinister.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't worry, we ain't gonna do any trust falls or relay races! I just wanna get to know you all a little better! In particular, I wanna know:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your favorite <strong>Bird</strong> (Oh, you know, bird-adjacent creature.)</li>
<li>Your favorite <strong>Seashell</strong> (Or any little trinket you could find at a beach.)</li>
<li>Your favorite <strong>Gift Shop Gift</strong> (Don't get too excited, we aren't opening this bad boy yet!)</li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;Don't pretend like you don't have a favorite seashell.&quot; Victor continues to smirk and click his pen. &quot;We've all got one!&quot;. He leans against the wall of the shop at looks expectantly around for anyone to come forward. Sometimes he tries to do a cool trick with his clipboard.</p>

<p>Hearing the words from a distance the demon's head pivots 120 degrees towards the man, fixating on his the pen he's fidgeting with. With deft speed Matilda approaches Victor attempting to grab the butt of the pen in his hand, her eyes filled with anger.</p>

							<div class='conversation-post-body'>
<p>&quot;Now hold on there Miss! DON'T BE FOOLED.&quot;</p>
<p>Jim stumbles onto the scene, belly fat jiggling from the inertia as his body comes to a stop. He doesn't get a good look at the girl but he charges right up the man and speaks in a condescending tone.</p>
<p>&quot;I know your deal. You're trying to upcharge this fine lady on the price of her bungalow!&quot;</p>
<p>He turns to the girl, his eyes unable to focus from the amount of drink he's ingested since this morning.</p>
<p>&quot;Take it from me. You do not want a new room. It's gonna be five times as expensive and not even any better.&quot; &quot;Oh, ItS gOt A NiCe ViEW?&quot; he mimicks. &quot;Yeah right, that's not worth that kind of money, much less the time wasted on dealing with YOU&quot;</p>
<p>Jim turns back to Victor on the last word, his eyes suddenly able to focus again. Jim frowns. Something felt odd about this interaction. Maybe it was the fact that I rhymed, Jim thinks to himself.</p>
<p>&quot;Heh, view with you, pretty clever huh. I often outdo even myself.&quot; Jim says softly, looking up and scratching his shaved chin.</p>

<p>Victor squints at Jim, trying to figure out if he is being sarcastic.
&quot;All our bungalows have great views, dude!&quot; Victor asserts. &quot;But ya won't be charged a penny for em while you're here!&quot;
Upon realising Jim's intoxication, he smiles.
&quot;Yeah, <em>'view with you'</em>. Very clever! You're a true brainiac, sir.&quot;</p>
<p>He then turns to Matilda, not realising until now that she was trying to grab the pen out of his hand. He looks a little surprised to see her so close.
&quot;What? Oh, yeah, sorry. Distracted.&quot;
He stops clicking the pen.
&quot;What's a beach? Well I like to tell myself that life's a beach, but really a beach is just the sandy thing we happen to be on at the moment. You know, the thing by the uh... sea?&quot;
He gestures nonchalantly at the golden mass leading out towards the crystal blue water.
&quot;And a seashell is one of those white things you find scattered around on 'em sometimes. Like from dead animals or whatever.&quot;
&quot;You like... pretty gifts? Ducks? Alright, alright, good to know!&quot;
He smiles a little hesitantly, only just now regaining his full composure.</p>

<p>&quot;Nah dude, the room is free. No selling or buying needed! Uh, if the view is an issue, we can cover up the windows for you?&quot;
Victor seems a little taken aback by Matilda's mannerisms, but only a little. He pauses and thinks for a moment.
&quot;Sea shells are... uh... oh shoot, actually I don't know. Are they bones? I don't think I ever found out...&quot;</p>

<p>Completely ignoring Victor, Jim says to Matilda, &quot;You can't be asking that many questions&quot; while shaking his head. With a conspiracy theory tone, he starts,
&quot;That's how they get you. The more you ask, the more they insist everything's okay. Next thing you know, you've spent all your money on a room that costs nothing for them. You can't even show up to bingo night then. The old folks there will just laugh you out of the building. Then, what do you do?&quot; Jim pauses, waiting for Matilda to answer.</p>
<p>Realizing Victor is still here with his clipboard, Jim rattles off, &quot;Sand dollars are pretty neat. I got one right here.&quot; He holds up a small sand dollar with an encrusted barnacle and shoves it back in a coat pocket before you get a good look. &quot;As for favorite bird, this seagull will do. I got it right here.&quot; He reaches into his other pocket and pulls out a dead gull that has a scared look on its face. Jim frowns and tosses it over his shoulder, muttering &quot;gave him crackers, not my fault.&quot; Turning back to Victor, he says &quot;Uhh, and I couldn't find the gift shop. So there.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&quot;My favorite bird... around our old lab, there was these sparrows with large wings we'd see on occasion. Migrating and the like. It was fun to bird watch with the others. As for seashells...&quot; Shunny picks up one of those spinny ones you can put your ear to and hands it to Victor. &quot;I didn't really have a lot of time for that back at home. But these shells do take me back; back when I first came to land. El and I would listen to these in our spare time. As for the third one... I... don't know? I've never been to a gift shop before...&quot;</p>

<p>Victor takes the shell and presses it up against his own ear.
&quot;Yeah, haha. Though I guess you don't really need a shell to hear the sea at the moment, huh?&quot;
He peers at the shell again and scribbles something on his clipboard before handing it back to Shunny.
&quot;Never been to a gift shop? That's fair, maybe you ain't missing out on much, hehe. Well, what kind of gifts do you typically like to receive?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I suppose I'll take part in your game,&quot; Elissandra saunters over, smiling slightly. &quot;Let's see... my favorite bird would be the phoenix, for its resilience and beauty. As for my favorite seashell, that is an easy question to answer, as I have many shells that I use as decoration at home. However, my most favorite is the abalone shell. I love how shiny they are!&quot; Elissandra hops ever so slightly after that last statement, looking almost like a giddy schoolgirl before quickly resuming her line of thought. &quot;I can't say I have been to many gift shops before, but if I had to pick a favorite gift, it would be candy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Have you never seen an abalone shell before?&quot; she inquires. &quot;Some of my hair adornments are made from it, see,&quot; she turns her head to one side and points to the long, pearlescent clips in her hair. &quot;The shell is treated as a luxury in my realm.&quot;</p>

<p>Marshal struts up slowly, gazing around the general area. &quot;Gotta be real with you, I don't really know much about any of these.&quot;</p>
<p>He thinks for a moment, before raising a finger.
&quot;Crows. Ravens? Maybe both. I've only seen a few of 'em, but I think we got a lot in common.&quot;
He raises a second finger.
&quot;I've seen a picture of conch shells once, I guess. I read they have some kinda cool ambience if you put one to your ear. Looks nice.&quot;
A third finger raises.
&quot;It's my favorite in the sense that I have to ask <em>why</em> it's a gift. Why <strong>pocket sand</strong>? Couldn't you just, you know... dry out the sand here and then put it in your pocket?&quot;</p>
<p>He puts his hand down and clears his throat.
&quot;I mean, it just evokes a lot of questions.&quot;</p>

<p>Ferg walks up to victor and takes off his shell necklace. He says, quite bluntly, &quot;Ferg favorite bird is vulture. Vulture show where animals die, make hunting and tracking easier. Ferg never go to giieft shawp, but ferg just check and ferg think poestcahrd (he sounds out the oddly spelt words quite slowly) nice.&quot;
He pauses for a minute
&quot;As for shell...&quot; He fingers his way through the shells on his necklace...&quot;This one.&quot; He lands on a small, thumbnail-sized shell with black, white, and deep blue mottling. &quot;This shell loved by wife, so is ferg favorite too. You need take?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Another postcard fan, huh? Good stuff. Good stuff&quot;
Victor looks up from the clipboard he is scribbling on as Ferg offers him the shell.
&quot;Oh, no no!&quot; He waves it away. &quot;It's a very nice shell, I could never take something like that from you! If anything, <em>I</em> should be the one giving out prized shells!&quot;</p>

<p>Victor begins to write on the clipboard, but when Kal-Ei starts to talk about gift shops, he pauses.</p>
<p>&quot;Gift shops are for getting gifts for... like... anyone I guess. Yourself, your friends, family, coworkers. You know, like a little memento you went somewhere or did something!&quot;</p>
<p>After a second, he adds:

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB6YotDQ_ow">Strange music</a> is already emanating from Shopkeeper as he approaches. He starts to draw in the sand with the butt of his staff. First a bird, then a seashell, and lastly a bomb.</p>
<p>He taps the top of the bird that looks like one of those hand traced turkeys. The d12 rolls with a brief flicker, stopping firmly on 9. The shopkeeper brushes a stray thread from their sleeve, as though fixing a minor imperfection. &quot;It’s been a bit of a downer lately. But I’ll survive, one way or another. Just one of those days, I guess.&quot; Their hands remain still as they observe you quietly, waiting for the next exchange.</p>
<p>The staff moves, tapping just above the depiction of some Fibonacci sequence -esque seashell. The d12 shifts beneath the robe with a rhythmic roll, landing squarely on 6. The shopkeeper gives an absent-minded flick of their staff, looking unbothered. &quot;Don’t overthink it, but... Sometimes, things have a way of shifting once you’re in too deep. But whatever, it’s probably just all in your head.&quot; They watch you closely, their tone slightly sharper as if they expect more now.</p>
<p>Lastly, his staff moves to a very clear depiction of a bomb. The d12 rolls with purpose, landing with precision on 10. The shopkeeper gives an absent-minded flick of their staff, looking unbothered. &quot;I’m glad we finally reached this point. I’m honestly surprised it took this long. I can only imagine the internal struggle.&quot; They glance at you with a hint of mild curiosity, as though they’re waiting for something better.</p>
<p>&quot;Wink.&quot; he says, as he is a dice man who cannot wink.</p>

<p>&quot;Wink received.&quot; Victor says playfully as he looks over the dice's drawings, scribbling on his clipboard.
&quot;I'm, uh... glad we reached this point as well.&quot;
He bites his lip a little as rapidly shifts his gaze between the seashell and his clipboard.
&quot;...I need like, a camera. Or something...&quot; he murmurs to himself.</p>

<p>&quot;What a strange set of questions.&quot;</p>
<p>Sariya looks at Victor with a confused look on her face.</p>
<p>&quot;My favorite bird is probably the swan. They get to live such calm lives with their unmarred white feathers. I can't say I really have an answer for the other two questions. I grew up in a landlocked area and the closest sea was destroyed by irrigation projects. And with the state of things back home, things like gift shops aren't exactly common anymore. That said, it was always a common courtesy in the old days to gift people flowers when visiting.&quot;</p>

&quot;Funny you mention that, I would say that's my favorite bird right there.&quot;</p>
<p>A pure white seabird dancing on the breeze catches your eye, it's form is smooth, it's feather pristine, and you see it glide down and land a few yards away.</p>

<p>&quot;No Booker, our friend here said no to kumbaya, but does have a few questions for us.&quot;

<p>&quot;Oh the topic of shells, I haven't seen many of this type on this island, and in recent years on my planet they have been appearing less and less frequently.&quot;
&quot;I do not know the technical term, but a kind older fellow once told me they were called angel wings.&quot;
&quot;They are more on the delicate side, and have intricate detail, but are easily broken. So you must be gentle with them if you want them to last.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't believe I have a need for them now, plus I have a few at home that I hold a bit more dear.&quot;
&quot;To be quite honest, despite the sand the beach is one of my favorite places.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Heyyy, man after my own heart. It's such a freeing place, ain't it? 'Specially when there ain't so many folks around. Sand a bit too course and rough for you, huh?&quot; He chuckles to himself.</p>

<p>&quot;Sand admittedly isn't my favorite part, as when I get back home or to the room it gets everywhere and even I struggle to ensure it is all gone, but something about the beach being just sand is comforting. Nothing to clean there, it's where sand is meant to be, it's everywhere always. I true constant in this world.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Heck yeah, dude, I vibe with that. Can't exactly clutter up a billion tiny rocks I 'spose. Though sometimes people like to leave their trash strewn about... Thankfully I cleaned it all up 'fore you folks arrived so you didn't need to wipe down the whole beach before we set sail!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is it common for the people of your world to leave trash lying around? The many races of my home world may be at odds but I don't think something so so senseless could ever become a regular occurrence. Though I suppose any world that has an absence of treants or nymphs might not be so swiftly punished for such transgressions against the earth.&quot;</p>

<p>He puts his hand on his chin thinking for a moment.
&quot;From my perspective it seems fairly common. Trash on the streets, in parks, on beaches, really almost anywhere.&quot;
&quot;Though given my title and my sensibilities, it could be possible I notice it more than most.&quot;</p>
<p>He seems to get in his own head for a moment, arms dropping to his sides as he continues his spiel.
&quot;Even if it maybe common, doesn't make it right. I wish all the trash and grime could be gone. I wish to clean the world, one step at a time. The scum of the earth will be removed.&quot;</p>

<p>“A favorite bird…and a favorite shell? Those…hmm…we suppose that we have favorites…though the shades seem to be arguing amongst themselves about this now, so I will seize the initiative and express MY favorites.” Cendre steps forwards, folding his arms and walking around the area slowly. “But, as for gift shops? I’m afraid there really isn’t one in the ruins I live in…and I seldom go elsewhere. I do suppose…that when I HAVE traveled or are visited by merchant caravans, I seek out book merchants. As a writer AND an avid reader, I adore them, obviously.”</p>
<p>Turning about face, Cendre snaps his fingers and produces a small spark of flame for a brief moment. “My favorite bird…is non other than a legendary type of monster in our world. The ever-burning phoenix. A bird whose power of rebirth allows it to rise from its own ashes. Beautiful in every aspect with its rainbow plumage and dazzling display of…firepower. There are very few of them, and just the mere sight of one is said to grant extreme fortune.”</p>
<p>“As for shells, I’m rather fond of the nautilus shell. I find the spiral shape appealing.”</p>

<h1>Day 1 Jonathan Event</h1>
<p>Jonathan finally steps out from behind the bar, clapping his hands. It seems as though the waves of the ocean echo the sound of his clapping, as they sound throughout the common room.</p>
<p>&quot;If I may have your attention,&quot; he says, loudly, but in a polite tone. &quot;The island wishes to see your... creative capabilities. And as such, it demands that you go out upon our white sand beach and... build a sandcastle. It is quite serious about this.&quot; He sighs.</p>
<p>&quot;You may work either alone or with whoever you want to complete the sandcastle. Once it is done, whether or not the island is impressed, you may request us to stock extra of one item in the room you visit, while removing another. Thank you, and please, go on.&quot;</p>
<p>OOC: If you build a sandcastle, you may request in public to Jonathan to remove 1 item from the Random Reward pool (specifically those marked with &quot;RR&quot; in the items list) and replace it with another. For example, you may Request a <em>Disposable Camera</em> be replaced with a <em>Guest List,</em> thus removing the camera from your possible rolls, and doubling you chances of receiving a Guest List. This only affects <em>your</em> Random Reward roll, not the rest of the room. Let your choice be known in public!</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I don't think I've built one, ever... But I'll give it a try. Can't be too difficult, right?&quot;</p>
<p>He sees the other impressive castles from the other groups already and decides to strive for something average. Scooping some sand into a small pile, he tries to shape it but it falls through his fingers back into the pile.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe we need to get a little water involved. Do you know any tricks to this?&quot;</p>
<p>Jim starts working on amassing a large pile of wet sand 2 feet tall and 3 feet in diameter. He adds 4 pillars at the front by dripping wet sand on the same spot.</p>
<p>&quot;What would you like to add to our perfect castle, miss?&quot; Jim says, wiping his brow with a hand full of wet sand.</p>

<p>&quot;We need at least one large tower, and a moat,&quot; Elissandra declares, inspecting the castle-in-progress. She scoops large handfuls of wet sand and places them on top, shaping them into conical towers. Then, squatting down in the sand, she starts digging a shallow moat around the structure, letting tidewater from the incoming waves fill it.</p>

<p>&quot;A moat's a good idea. Everyone loves a moat.&quot; Jim says, as he helps dig the moat around the back of the castle.
Jim frowns at the water getting so close to their work.
&quot;Well, we should finish this up quick. Time's a tickin.&quot;
He looks for some shells or small rocks around the area to add as finishing touches. Jim gathers a decent handful of rocks but seems to be looking for more.</p>

Placing the sand dollar and shells in, he finishes the letter E and stands up. The trinkets spell out &quot;J + E&quot;
&quot;It's to show that it's ours. What do ya think?&quot;</p>

<p>The d12 shifts languidly beneath the robe, like it’s too tired to care, settling on 2. The shopkeeper barely moves, their posture drooping with the same lethargy. &quot;Ah, of course, this is exactly what I wanted. I’m not losing my patience, yet. Who needs peace and quiet when you’ve got this?&quot; They let out a soft chuckle, nodding as if to say, &quot;That was almost interesting.&quot;</p>
<p>Shopkeeper begins to slowly craft a sandcastle using some sort of slow and delicate magic. Their staff hums all the while, lifting sand into place. Over twenty minutes, a depiction of a castle full of sand monsters is formed, as well as a half dozen heroic looking adventurer-like sand people being blown apart and eviscerated.</p>
<p>When done, they place their hands on their hips and sigh, letting the staff float in place for a moment. He trots on over to Jonathan and gently taps the top of his staff against the man's arm.</p>
<p>The d12 rolls with purpose, landing with precision on 10. The shopkeeper gives an absent-minded flick of their staff, looking unbothered. &quot;I don’t know, it just feels a little fishy. But, I can’t shake the feeling something’s off. Not blaming you, but still...&quot; A brief flash of excitement dances through their motion as they stare fixated on you, ready for whatever comes next.</p>

<p>Jonathan nods in appreciation of the impressive sandcastle, looking down at the d12 creature. &quot;Very good sir. Work of art. Perhaps should you survive, Victor can photograph it and you can take your resort memories with you.

<p>He looks around for a moment, determining who could help him in this task.</p>
<p>He starts by drawing out a 6 foot by 6 foot base, and gathers, grasses, seaweed, drift wood and natural materials to strengthen the castle.</p>
<p>&quot;If we use the drift wood as a frame and mix the grasses and seaweed with the wet sand we can strengthen the sand structures tensile strength.&quot;</p>
<p>He is musing about when he starts calling on people for help.</p>
<p>&quot;Booker Hopkins and Vegael could you both give me a hand with laying the foundation?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Kal-Ei you sir! You look like a tall fellow who could help me make this a large structure.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Does anyone have any idea's on the design? There are not many castles where I come from.&quot;

<p>He stands up, something shiny in his hand. He hands several tiny glass cones and spikes to Mr. Clean. &quot;A pale shadow of what could have been, but they should suffice as decoration.

<p>&quot;I know what they are, but I've never played in sand before,&quot; Vegael said. She was using a stick to break up some of the packed subsurface sand, so it was easier to scoop up. &quot;Something about scratches on our paint that would increase our radar cross-section marginally enough for it to be an issue.&quot;</p>

&quot;Sounds like a substantial issue, I could see where that could be a problem.&quot;
&quot;Did they ever give yall new coats of paint?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing wrong with having some fun when you are grown&quot;
He gives a smile.
&quot;I never experienced a true childhood, I have always been, well me. With minor changes through the decades.&quot;
&quot;I will say the early years where I knew less and didn't worry as much were nice though. Ignorance is truly bliss sometimes, but can come with it's own cost.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They did, but they did not like doing so. The paint is some special radar-absorbing paint made of materials that would land you in prison if you happened to know its composition without the clearances. It is a hassle to reapply.&quot;
Vegael continued to break up the tough sand with the long stick.
&quot;If you want to know I can tell you, seeing that the law of my land has no power here.&quot;</p>

<p>Done placing the support structure into the holes dug by Clean, Kal-Ei sits next to the castle foundation that begins to form. It is hard to appropriately describe the extremely dissonant spectacle of this tower of a man, busy delicately shaping and patting the sand Vegael has been piling to pack it into a more solid structure.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the main square of this gigantic and honestly quite magnificent sand castle is now taking shape.</p>

<p>He takes a moment to look around seeing the castle slowly take shape.
&quot;Great work so far, this is turning into a beaut.&quot;
He begins mixing wet sand with the grasses and seaweed and placing it around the structures Kal-Ei placed. The texture of the wet sand reminds you of cement, but it seems to set faster than that. As the structure is covered in this mixture he switches to just adding normal sand on top for a smoother finish.</p>

<p>&quot;Smart thinking, I remember being buried in the sand once. Though it was much more shallow, part of a fun beach day and less of a health risk.&quot;

<p>&quot;I've seen plenty of pretty beaches myself, though most from a high altitude. The closest I've gotten to one before was when I had a PR thing in a big coastal city, when the Air Force was finally willing to admit that we existed. They told us not to get close to the sand, but the amount of people who wanted to touch our wings should've been a touch more of a concern than the sand.&quot;</p>

&quot;Unwanted touch and attention is never fun to deal with. If you don't mind me asking how long did they keep you in the dark before revealing you all to the public?&quot;
&quot;Having your first public event with people close enough to try and touch you all seems like a big oversight on the Air Force's part.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Between our first flight and our first public appearance, about seven years. And it was made very clear that there would be really harsh penalties for anyone who tried. Regardless, there were some that did so, and that was when the greater crowd realized that absolutely none of the event security had tasers or guns.&quot;
Vegael had a slight grin recalling that memory. She had finished putting together the outer wall.
&quot;Fortunately, I and the rest of my squadron were able to take off right before the crowd tried to rush forward and snag a souvenir or two. Made for a very funny story in the paper, the next day.&quot;</p>

He smirks continuing to smooth out the sand along the supports, the castle seems to be coming along nicely with the group's work, 4 sturdy walls and turrets appear to be taking shape currently reaching about waist height for Mr. Clean.</p>

<p>&quot;I partially blame the press for it,&quot; the plane-person replied. &quot;They were talking about how awesome we were, that people needed a look... and one or two deranged tabloids that said something like how our paint tiles can cure all ailments if ground up and put in tea. Occam's Razor says people were just excited, I personally like to believe the last point because the idea is ridiculous enough to be funny. Considering your nature as a mascot, I can imagine there are many people who are a bit too eager to meet you.&quot;</p>
<p>She had cut down a section on the front of the wall, to assemble a gate out of the large sticks that had been collected.</p>
<p>&quot;My favorite thing to fly over... depends on the circumstances. I love flying over cities if flying casually. Otherwise, and you might find this ironic, flying over enemy anti-air defenses is something I find gratifying, because they are incapable of seeing me. Almost all of the time.&quot;</p>

<p>He catches himself and chuckles.
&quot;Pardon my language I got a little too comfortable there.&quot;
He moves onto the back wall to start building it up a bit more.</p>
<p>&quot;As a mascot, people are eager to meet you sometimes, with most kids and some adults, it's honestly adorable and quite enjoyable.&quot;
&quot;However with some people who are a bit older and should know better, it's a bit more uncomfortable when they cross boundaries, but even then I try to not put myself in situations where it could happen in the first place. Sometimes it can't be avoided though.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I could see how flying over a city could be enjoyable, there is a lot to see there.&quot;
&quot;I do have a question though, for that second part you mentioned, was it gratifying to fly unseen because you were unassailed or was it the idea of being imperceptible was freeing?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I quite agree. Aircraft maintainence and upkeep involve some of the most toxic chemicals around. Unsure what they were thinking there.&quot;</p>
<p>Vegael had finished the front gate to a seemingly acceptable state. She chuckles at Mr Clean's comment about lead in the paint.</p>
<p>&quot;But certainly, I imagine there are some demographics more interested than others. For us, it was military geeks and the occasional spy. Thankfully, that PR stunt was the closest it ever got, most other times it was people with cameras trespassing onto airfields. They refused to give us handheld service weapons despite our insistence.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As for why I liked flying over enemy guns... I suppose it is a bit of both. Even if they don't see me, they know something is there. So they sometimes fire wildly, missing me by a long shot. And the fact that I don't need to worry about evasive maneuvers like the F-111s. I don't even have flares, chaff, or jammers. I simply am invisible.&quot;</p>

<p>After getting the current side wall he was working on to the same height as the back, he moves to the other side wall. Working, but listening intently.</p>
<p>&quot;The military geeks and spy's make more sense to me, I could see how the average person might get excited with your squadron for sure, but I'm never going to get over the fact people in your world thought paint could heal ailments.&quot;
He shakes his head a bit with a smile, he really can't seem to get over the paint and finds it quite amusing.</p>
<p>As he works on the wall he continues.
&quot;Invisibility sounds like a nice ability to have, especially in situations like you describe. It sounds quite freeing.&quot;
He briefly glances at a seabird nearby which has landed on the beach and has seeming taken an interest in the castle. It is slowly tiptoeing towards the front of the building and Vegael, cocking it's head to the side.</p>

<p>He nods in understanding, not having much more to say at the moment, but glancing at the bird and just shaking his head.</p>

<p>He looks up and his beaming smile returns.
&quot;Looks like you got some more materials! Just was making some small talk and getting to know one another better.&quot;
Mr. Clean looks back at the structure appraising it.
&quot;I think with the work we have done here we don't have too much farther to go, just a bit more sand on each side and any decorations we would like to add on each side.&quot;</p>
<p>At this point the walls are just below his chest from the work everyone has done so far and the front wall looks quite detailed from Vegaels work.</p>
<p>He looks over to Kal- Ei
&quot;I haven't gotten to talk much to you yet, so I'll ask some similar questions just to keep the conversation flowing.&quot;

<p>&quot;I have been to beaches, though rarely for personal leisure. It's a far too relaxed place for me to enjoy. The sand though... The sand reminds me of the desert.&quot; He pulls up a handful of sand, the golden grains drifting in between his fingers.</p>
<p>&quot;See, at the beginning of our history, my... tribe, though it has been millennia since I have called it such, was born from the sand of the desert. We lived and died on those fiery dunes, knew the scorching heat of the sun and little else. My first time seeing the sea, I was in pure disbelief to see so much water all in one place.&quot; As he speaks, he starts modeling a few towers and battlements. &quot;Speaking of sea and water. You were forming foams and bubbles earlier. Some sort of... soap? Is that some kind of arcana of your world?&quot;</p>

<p>Vegael moved onto the inner stronghold of the sandcastle after finishing the turrets at each wall corner. She was sculpting something that looked along the lines of a castle. But the details looked a bit too specific for it to be any generic castle; it was a little asymmetric, built on a hill, and the detailing of small buildings within were starting to appear. Was this a specific castle she knew of?</p>
<p>Vegael's eyes were a little glazed over; it seemed like she had zoned out while working on it.</p>

<p>He smiles, adding more sand to the top of the current wall he is working on and smoothing it out.
&quot;Being born of sand seems almost biblical, your story and tribe seem like one, writers would be sure to etch down in history.&quot;</p>
<p>He looks back at the bubbles nearby and gives a smirk.
&quot;I guess one could call it magic, magic in a bottle. It only has one purpose though, and that is to clean.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can entertain you with some of my abilities later though if you would like.&quot;
His twinkle and there is a hint of mischief in the air as finishes that last statement.</p>

<p>He picks up on the look in her eyes and pipes up.
&quot;So what are you sculpting over there Vegael? Something from home?&quot;</p>

<p>Vegael herself didn't seem to notice what it was she was building, until she glanced down. It took a moment for her eyes to focus, and when it did, a jolt of <em>terror</em> seemed to strike her. She gave a yelp, and jumped back just a little.</p>
<p>&quot;Ar- Arvoke,&quot; she gasped. Her breaths came out quickly, and the next shuddering words that came from her were, &quot;It's... it's nothing. J-just a castle. Just...&quot;</p>

<p>Concern crosses his features once again.
He leans over, careful to offer support, but not force it and holds out his hand.
&quot;If you need to take a break for a bit, I understand. We can finish up here, not too much more to do at the moment anyways.&quot;
His hand remains extended, but doesn't move farther, waiting for a reply.</p>

<p>He smiles again.
After helping a sturdy hand, he gives her a steadying hand on the shoulder until it seems she is steady.
&quot;No worries, just make sure to stay hydrated or engine oiled and maybe sit in the shade for a while. It might be the heat getting to you with the black paint and all. When you are ready we can call it and let Mr. Bramblewood know we are ready.&quot;
With that he retracts his hand.</p>

<p>After being sure she's sat down somewhere with shade he turns looking at Kal-Ei and letting out a sigh.
He speaks quietly in a low voice.
&quot;You know, I understand these are all adults, but some of these people... they are so young and yet have gone through so much.&quot;
&quot;From what I can glean, you are a bit on the older side like myself.&quot;
&quot;I wish these youngsters who already seen to have a great deal of trauma were not forced into a competition like this. I can see why they are here, strong and full of vigor, but I wish it wasn't wasted on such an environment like this.&quot;</p>

<p>Kal-Ei's gaze follows Vegael's figure as she walks over to the trees. He sadly nods at Clean's words. &quot;Old or young, certain things scar you forever. Many soldiers were no longer the same after risking their life in battle. Maybe this island favors those who have a story to tell, but that often comes as a price.&quot; His eyes move to the man in white. &quot;We can do nothing to change this, but believe me. I would if I could.&quot;</p>
<p>With that said, he stands up. &quot;A moment.&quot; He then walks to the tiki bar and asks Jonathan Bramblewood: &quot;My friend under those palm trees over there, she's not feeling well. If you have any kind of motor oil, or oil lubricant of any sorts, could you bring it to her? In a glass. Ice cold.&quot;</p>
<p>Whatever the response is, he thanks the bartender and returns to the castle area, continuing to build in silence.</p>

<p>&quot;If you can stomach it, here.&quot; He says down to the resting Vegael. Notably he doesn't have a glass, but has merely hauled over a plastic container along with a funnel.</p>

<p>Paul presses his lips together awkwardly as he hears the announcement. Soon after, he silently looks around and gathers basic sand castle creating equipment, including a small pail and hand shovel. He sits down, cross-legged, at the water's edge and begins scooping sand into the pail, putting it upside down to create small towers of a crude castle.</p>
<p>The sand isn't quite wet enough, and isn't quite packed enough. The walls of the towers crumble with the breeze. He tries to put another pile of sand on top of three of the towers and it collapses anticlimactically. He grimaces and turns around, starting anew. After some time, he creates one that is less ambitious, but at least standing. This time his castle consists of four spaced out towers in a square, with a pile of sand in the middle and a stick coming out of the center.</p>
<p>He looks around awkwardly, seeking out Jonathan. When he does, he gestures at his castle with a grimace. &quot;Um, it's done...&quot;</p>

<p>Ferg spends a short time observing, but eventually realizes the nature of this 'sand castle.' Once he has figured out the prompt, he sets to work gathering wet sand from the shore and shaping it into a circle on the ground. &quot;Lamb! Lamb &quot; He shouts. &quot;You want built sand tent with ferg? Ferg will need many hands...ferg have big plans&quot;</p>

<p>Ferg labors for a while until he has a large ring in the sand, roughly 5 feet across, and maybe 3 feet tall. During the shaping process he periodically plucks a shell off of his necklace, or finds one from the sand, decorating the sand castle in a geometric pattern of seashells, large wide swathes spiraling up its height with smaller branches jutting out at regular angles</p>

<p>Eventually the final form of ferg's sand castle comes into form; a conical, tent-like structure, shaped almost like a teepee, except only large enough to fit maybe one man within. There is a small hole dug out of the center, only big enough to lie down in. The outside is decorated entirely in shells, seemingly outlining the places where different hides would be layered atop one another to form the walls of the tent. At its peak is a shell, no larger than a thumbnail, of white, black, and deep blue mottle.</p>

<p>Lamb approched cautiously once she heard Ferg shout her name. She approached low as if stalking something. Once she reaches Ferg she remains crouched and head tilted. She doesn't move while Ferg builds the castle. The occasional rustle of her pale fur in the wind and changing which direction her head was tilted in.</p>
<p>Saying nothing she watches as Ferg builds the castle. When the castle is done she looks down at a sea shell in the sand by her hooves. Delicately she lifts it up to the mask examining it. Before placing it back down and looking back to Ferg and the castle. &quot;You are a craftsmen? I did not know craftsmen could build with sand.&quot;</p>

<p>After a short few steps Matilda closes in on a pantry containing a number of jars, fruits, vegetables, and preserved meats. With a chomp a wide mouth closes down upon the foods, spitting out a few pieces of glass from the jars.</p>

<p>&quot;You know if you have trouble with jars, I could have opened those for you.&quot;</p>
<p>A tall bald man stands behind you leaning against one of the tiki huts supports, arms crossed over his chest. He seems to be watching you, not scared, but amused by the display before him.</p>

<p>He comes out of his lean walking forward, uncrossing his arms and reaching for the jar.</p>
<p>He holds the jar up and points at the glass.
&quot;This is the container.&quot;
He points at the silver top.
&quot;This is the lid.&quot;</p>
<p>He smiles, gripping the jar with one hand and the lid with the other, making eye contact with you and with an audible <em><strong>pop</strong></em>, the jar opens and he pulls away the lid setting it down on the counter.</p>
<p>He passes it back to you pointing inside.
&quot;That's where the good stuff is.&quot;
&quot;If this doesn't suit your fancy there are plenty of other types.&quot;
It appears to be a jar of peach halves and he takes a fork from a drawer swiping one from the top and taking a bite of it.</p>

<p>The demon nods lightly as Mr. Clean explains it again.
Quickly grabbing another jar, this time of olives Matilda seemingly excitedly twists the lid to the right.
Reminiscent to two of the last few sounds a <strong>pop</strong> is heard.</p>
<p>After swiftly stabbing an olive with a claw and putting it in her maw Matilda turn bites down with delight before looking back at the man.</p>

<p>&quot;I should be able to do most of it myself, but if you would like to help you are certainly welcome to wash those tomatoes and a few leaves of lettuce.&quot;
He points over to a bowl on the counter that appears to hold some of the red fruit and a head of lettuce.
He move further into the space rummaging around a bit to find more ingredients.</p>
<p>&quot;So what do you like to do with your free time?&quot;</p>

<p>Matilda looks confusedly towards the lettuce and tomatoes on the counter but continues on to try and carry them over to a basin nearby. In a struggle to grab and hold on to the tomatoes a couple fall to the ground with a splatter. After the few mistakes here and there, she makes it to the basin, pulling a pump up and down to draw some water from the ground beneath.
After placing the fruits and vegetables in the water she goes pack to gather the scraps of a bruised and crushed tomato on the ground, swiftly throwing the damaged products  in her mouth.</p>

<p>He comes back from the fridge with ground beef, bacon, cheese, and an onion. He rummages around a bit more for sauces and spices and once satisfied starts with cutting up the veggies.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you for the help, Matilda.&quot;
He works quietly for a bit, content with the company, and after finishing the veggies starts forming the patties and adding salt, spices, and some Worcestershire.
He washes his hands, dries them, and pulls out a large pan.
Seeing as it is an electric stove he oils the pan places it down and starts up the heat.</p>
<p>After a while of silence, he speaks again.</p>
<p>&quot;This is one of the first recipes I was taught, my old friend gave me a lesson after we cleaned her house. Should be just as good now as it was then.&quot;
&quot;What about you, do you have any hobbies that remind you of friends back home?&quot;</p>

&quot;Juice is a delicious beverage.&quot;
He steps away finding some grape juice in the fridge pouring two glasses and passing one her way.
&quot;What did you study, and who was your friend? &quot;
He leans against the counter for a moment, holding his hand over the pan to see how much it had heated.
&quot;My friend passed several years back, but the friendship was great while it lasted, and I still visit her resting place once a year to chat.&quot;
&quot;I find chatting with friends to be one of the most relaxing things in this world.&quot;</p>

<p>Feeling the pan is at an adequate heat he takes two of the patties putting them on one side of the pan and 4 slices of bacon on the other.
He covers the pan with a lid to prevent grease from popping out and heads back to the pantry rummaging around till he finds burger buns.
&quot;Happy to see they keep this establishment well stocked!&quot;
&quot;Studying grace is an interesting prospect, I had never thought of that before, remembering things can be hard sometimes, especially the longer you live.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;By the way, the burger has several different levels of being cooked, if you like your food more bloody that would be rare, if you like yours in between it's medium and if you like it fully cooked that's well. How would you like yours?&quot;</p>

<p>He then stand back up straight, finds the ball and appears to be looking it over, once satisfied he calls out.</p>

<p>He glances over with a smile.
&quot;If you change you mind you are welcome to join.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In this game the goal is to hit the ball over the net and have it land on the opponents side within these boundaries.&quot;
He points out the sides of the pit.
&quot;Usually good to have an even number of players on both sides to keep things fair. When the ball comes to your side to keep it from hitting the ground you can hit it back to the opponents side.&quot;
&quot;They can do the same and this can go back and forth until the ball hits the ground on one side giving a point to the opposing side.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For games like these it is usually good to have what we call in my world the referee and they ensure the game is being played fairly.&quot;</p>

<p>Vegael had stepped over to the outdoor, open-air showers, near the beach. She had a brush in one hand, and the soap Mr. Clean gave to her in the other.</p>
<p>She turned over to one of the showers and immediately turned it on, letting the water run over her. This was in spite of the fact that she was still fully clothed. After closing her eyes and letting the cool water soak her, she took the bottle of soap and dribbled some on the brush, and she immediately got to work with scrubbing down her flight suit, while it was still on her.</p>
<p>The black paint of the flight suit made it difficult to see any stains or grease that had accumulated in the crevices; it's something that most may have not noticed. As she scrubbed and the soap lathered, dark gray water dripped from her wings and flight suit, contaminated with all sorts of transmission fluid, oil, and grime. At the very least, it seemed to be making a bit of a mess of the shower floors.</p>

<p>You hear a laugh from around the corner and the arm retracts.
&quot;Works for me.&quot;
He still doesn't appear from around the shower, he seems to be at the other side looking in the opposite direction.
&quot;I'll admit, I hadn't thought you could get wet with all the electronics, but I could see how that would be a major oversight on the air forces part if you couldn't.&quot;
He pauses thinking for a moment.
&quot;Though I would imagine you would have a lot of drag using normal swimming methods with your flight suit, water is a bit more dense than air.&quot;</p>

<p>You don't hear a laugh, but there is a distinct smirk to his voice as he responds.
&quot;You know I'm sure you have much more of a reason to sink than I given you are part plane, but I do remember back in the 80's when I got the courage up to try and learn how to swim the first time I hit the water I sank a bit too, Charlie the tuna had to hop in and pull me out. Strong little guy, I'll give him that.&quot;
&quot;It took a while, but he eventually got me to a decent level. I do still hate treading though.&quot;</p>

<p>Vegael smiled, hearing the story. But she was somewhat half-listening; she was glancing between the bottle of soap Mr. Clean had provided her, and the red X-shaped mark over her Air Force insignias. She took the bottle and poured a generous amount of soap on the X, and used the brush she had to try to scrub it off. She scrubbed it harder and harder, ferociously, as though she was trying to sand it off-</p>
<p>And then, the brush cracked, loudly. She stopped, tossed the broken brush aside, and wiped the lathered soap away to see that the red X over her insignia was still there. As if mocking her.</p>
<p>&quot;Even this can't remove it,&quot; she murmured, to herself.</p>

<p>A hand slowly reaches forward again, still holding a pristine white towel.
&quot;Apologies friend this is currently the best I have, but we could see if this resort has a firepit or standing gas heater. Some of the ones I visited back home would usually light them at night. They maybe able to provide enough heat to help you dry off without having to brave the towel?&quot;</p>

<p>Having moved down the beach a way, Cendre seems to have moved one of the chairs from their bungalow. They sit with their legs crossed and seem to be just staring out into the ocean, though they are not alone. Two shades appear to be arguing nearby, one of them being the large man from earlier, Rod, while the other is a woman of much smaller stature, though her ears are noticeably pointed. Their shouting makes no noise, but their movements are somewhat wild and agitated.</p>
<p>At one point Rod looks at Cendre, shouting something at him, to which they response with a sigh. “I know you two like to have your quarrels, but don’t drag me into it. It’s been almost five hundred years…how have you two not gotten over your elf and dwarf rivalry…?” They shake their head, turning back towards the ocean as the two shades stare at them for a moment but then continue their silent shouting match.</p>

<p>Cendre turns to Kal-Ei, waving a hand at the two shades. “The questions Victor asked earlier led to the shades debating on various topics. These two are usually well tempered with each other, but Rod here said he preferred lizards and other underground creatures to birds, and of course this forest elf Lillian here leapt at the chance to insult him as a dwarf. It’s drove them towards all kinds of…oh.”</p>
<p>Stopping themselves, Cendre gestures again to Rod. “It’s worth noting that Rod here is much larger than the average dwarf. A case of gigantism. Regardless, arguments and conflict between elves and dwarfs aren’t rare, but it’s exhausting to hear again and again…and again.”</p>

<p>As the sun begins to shrink lower and lower, Lamb turns to face an open trail headed into the bush. She stares at it much the same as she did the ocean. Emotionless yet longing. After standing so still for so long the only thing showing she was not made of stone was the rustle of her pale fur in the breeze.</p>
<p>Eventually she begins to walk to the path. Her walk light and almost silent.</p>

<p>&quot;Well friend my night seems to be as eventful as anyone else's though I can't say the others are too keen on sharing their misadventures. Personally I got to learn how to operate this marvelous little thing they call a jet ski and enjoy the ocean's waves. Oh under the moonlight it was simply gorgeous!&quot;
He pauses a moment to set his plate on the counter and take a sip of his breakfast beer.
&quot;I won't pry if you're as secretive as the rest but know I do hope your night was filled with as much wonder.&quot;
He smiles and finishes off his beer before placing the mug beside the plate.
&quot;The food, the beer, the scenery. This place would be paradise if the circumstances weren't so unfavorable.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are right. Quite the irony to have such a peaceful place transformed into an excuse for violence.&quot; At those words, he looks behind him at Jonathan manning the bar. &quot;I wonder what force is setting all of this in motion.&quot;</p>

<p>Booker absentmindedly scratches his chin as he looks back at Jonathan.
&quot;Nothing good that's for sure. They're polite but I've known my way around snakes my entire life. Wouldn't trust him or blondie as far as- well as far as Ferg could throw them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;From how he speaks, it seems like they are also being controlled by something else. The island decided this, the island decided that... Maybe they are also victims.&quot; He looks back at you. &quot;Many slimy people where you come from? You seem like the kind of person who would put a smile even on the most evil of faces.&quot;</p>

<p>Not too far away from the tiki bar, Cendre sits at a round table with their hands folded in their lap, their head tilted down slightly. Joining them are two new shades, two women sitting equal distances away with a tea pot in the center of the table that the three seem to be sharing. One of the women, dressed in a robe with arcane symbols woven decoratively into the fabric, has a wide brimmed hat hanging off the back of her chair and a staff is propped up in the sand next to her with the tip having a red glow to it. The other woman appears to be slightly younger, wearing a battle dress that has similar emblems to the clothing Cendre is wearing. The ash that makes up her figure is noticeably more stable than the other woman, and as she taps her foot on the sand below her she audibly hums an unfamiliar tune. It appears this one is able to make sound, unlike the other shades.</p>
<p>Cendre themself has both a violin and their notebook in front of them, their pen in hand though they are not writing. As they sit, they reach up and grab their mask, the hand slowly sliding down it as they sigh with exasperation. “This island infuriates me…”</p>

<p>&quot;Hello, bard.&quot; Kal-Ei sits nearby, musing at the new and audible shadow of the battle maiden. &quot;Still trying to pursue your craft? I would love to hear a verse or two, if you are willing to offer.&quot;</p>

<p>“Hmm…” Cendre takes a brief look around, reaching up and adjusting their glove. “A morning on a sunny and warm beach…I may have a few songs that match this tone…but which one to choose?” They pick up their violin and ready it, but after a moment of them staying quiet to think the younger shade at the table set her tea down and smiles at him. “Cenne would play the Apple Festival’s song.”</p>
<p>Cendre looks towards her, nodding. “Ahh, my muse is right.”</p>
<p>The man of ash begins to play, an upbeat tune singing off the strings and echoing around the area, the sound accompanied by but not clashing with the sound of the nearby waves. The song starts off slowly, picking up pace as a few minutes pass, Cendre skillfully manipulating the instrument without a single noticeable pause or flaw in the song. After a while they end with a flourish, staying still for a moment as the final note reverberates through the area like a gust of wind, before lowering the violin and it’s bow back to the table.</p>

<p>A figure emerges from their bungalow. As the figure turns, the sunlight reflecting off their head, obscuring them from your view, shifts, and you can see Mr. Clean. A small towel around their neck suggests they may have just finished a swim. It’s early, but at this point, the sun has fully risen, suggesting they may have been watching as it slowly rose over the water.
As he steps out, there seems to be one last kink in his neck, and he stretches slightly while looking at the water. Once satisfied, he makes his way to the kitchen and sees the spread before him.
Well, this man’s desires are simple.
He begins to pull out multiple plates and puts them in a stack at the end of the kitchen island, which looks to be about 18 or so. Then pulling out pans, and cranking up the heat on the stove, he begins to make breakfast. Pancakes, bacon, and saving eggs for last, perhaps to get people's orders for how they want them. As the pancakes are finished, he puts them on a preheated stone serving platter to keep them warm, and a similar plate for the bacon, sitting them in the center of the kitchen island. He’s set out a variety of toppings he managed to find in the cabinets and fridge including syrup, berries, chocolate chips, and a much darker more viscous liquid set off at the opposite end of the island, the bottle looks slightly dirty, and is intentionally a bit farther away from the other food with a little note taped on the side. He’s humming a happy tune as he pours some oil into the pan seemingly ready to take people's orders on eggs.</p>

&quot;You that eager to get working in food service over here? Not too optimistic about tonight?&quot;</p>

&quot;But... you can consider this a backup if you would like.&quot;
His grin grows brighter flashing you an even larger smile.</p>
<p>After he seems happy with an adequate amount of sarcasm laced through his statements he pats one of the stools at the kitchen island and points to the plates.
&quot;Eat up young one! Can't have this food going to waste!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ahh, I've been on one of those before, for pleasure though, not pain.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Back where I am from we call that a cruise ship. It's another form of vacation resort, like the one we are in now, but aboard a boat.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It usually has everything from good food most don't get to try, entertainment in the form of shows, waterslides, and whatever other activities they can manage to cram on there, not to mention a gambling hall.&quot;</p>
<p>He chuckles.</p>
<p>&quot;Gambling hall was never my favorite, but I had some friends that enjoyed it a bit too much sometimes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The boat will take the passengers to various locations on a route where they can disembark enjoy the sights and hop back on to keep on partying.&quot;</p>

In no time at all he's finished the plate and is already set to cleaning the dish.

<p>&quot;I do enjoy cooking, like cleaning it feels like something I can control in this world. That's something I value in life.&quot;</p>

&quot;No my friend hobbit hash is-&quot;
He pulls his jacket pocket open to reveal his pipe and a small bag partly open that smells sickly sweet.
&quot;The lovely fixing for my dear pipe. Grows just above everywhere in the forests back home.&quot;

<p>He perks up at that a little and kind of looks back at the kitchen for a moment.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I've made <em>such</em> a mess here, it could use a good scrubbing.&quot;</p>
<p>He feigns a look of dismay.
He closes his eyes, leaning back against the counter putting the back of his hand to his head as if he were going to faint.</p>
<p>&quot;Truly what am I to do...&quot;
He pops one eye open to see if he's managed to garner any laughs and then straightens up.</p>
<p>&quot;In all seriousness, I do enjoy a good bit of cleaning, once people are done with breakfast, I'll clean up here and probably hit the beach or tiki bar to relax. Depends on how I am feeling.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not sure if what we will be doing today will be as fun as last night's adventures, but I had a fun time diving last night, albeit I was a tad bit confused as to where things were at some point. You had some fun yourself last night right?&quot;</p>

She glanced over the table, and her eyes brightened a little seeing the bottle of oil filled with the dark liquid. She picked it up, glanced at the note on it, then glanced over at Mr. Clean, who was currently preparing breakfast.</p>
<p>&quot;You can cook?&quot; she asked, glancing over at the pancakes and bacon that was already prepared.</p>

<p>He looks over, his smile broadening. His eyebrows quirk a bit, as if a little confused.
“I guess I have learned a few things from Janet over the years, but to be fair I figure cooking a good breakfast is simple enough it should be a staple everyone should know, regardless of skill.”
He thinks for a moment.
“You are part human, right? Was there a time before you served your country when you may have preferred something beyond engine oil?”
There is a hint of genuine curiosity in his voice.</p>

<p>&quot;Part human, yes. But I do not find much pleasure in eating, admittedly,&quot; Vegael admitted. &quot;The others in my squadron were more receptive to good food than I were. And I did eat normal food before becoming a plane-person, at the very least. Those meals were not wondrous, though.&quot;</p>

<p>He watches for a moment nodding, and decides to grab a plate and puts a few pancakes on there and 2 strips of bacon. As he is gathering his breakfast he responds.</p>
<p>“Everyone has their own preferences. I find there are two modes I usually find myself in.”</p>
<p>“1. Fuel up mode. These are the times when I have work to do or a place to be, usually in a rush or just too tired to care. Times like these I usually gravitate to quick food, less worried about taste or texture, so a smoothie or instant oatmeal usually.”</p>
<p>He pauses taking a whiff of the glorious meal in front of him.</p>
<p>“2. Savor the flavor. Like today, those are the times when I just want to be in the moment, relax, and eat a delicious meal.”</p>
<p>As he is talking he starts to put on a few berries and syrup over his pancakes, as he finishes he seems quite excited over the prospect of this meal and he is grinning ear to ear.</p>
<p>&quot;I know you mentioned meals in your past were not &quot;wonderous&quot;, but I find food and smells can harbor memories. Were there any meals from your past that hold that kind of sentiment for you?&quot;</p>

<p>Vegael nodded.</p>
<p>&quot;A good meal is fitting for today, considering...&quot;
She left the second part unsaid, and quickly changed the subject.</p>
<p>&quot;I suppose... very high-octane fuel. Not what you get out of a pump, but leaded 110 octane gasoline is what my squadron would consume after a hard-earned victory. It was not very good for us in large amounts, not at all - it was leaded, after all. But it was absolutely delicious, so we saved it for the best of times.&quot;</p>
<p>The plane-person seemed to be resisting the urge to click her lips, at the memory of the flavor.</p>

<p>He takes a bite as you speak he seems quite content at the moment. He’s leaning back against the counter focused on his food, but you can tell he is listening from the little nods he is making in between bites. He swallows a bite, pausing his consumption for a moment to reply.</p>
<p>“You know, the good stuff is never good for you anyway. Do you think these pancakes are the pinnacle of health? This bacon?”</p>
<p>He lets out a hearty laugh.</p>
<p>“As long as we eat the good stuff in moderation, all should be fine I suspect. One can’t live life in constant worry, or else how would you really even live at all.”</p>
<p>“After you win this thing, I would guess some of that 110-octane gasoline will be in order.”</p>
<p>He smiles for a moment and then continues to eat his pancakes, not quite scarfing them down as to be polite, but he does seem to eat his fill quite quickly. If you look too closely you’ll see a little wiggle of a dance with each bite containing a berry. He is quite content and could not look happier at the moment.</p>

<p>As the sun rises above the resort, Sariya sits in front of her bungalow, her rifle laid out on the ground. She begins to take it apart, inspecting the individual components.</p>
<p>“Safety is working. Trigger is functioning fine,” you can hear her mutter with a look of concentration on her face.</p>
<p>As she pulls the bolt carrier assembly out of the rifle, Sariya glances around the resort, seeing the others congregating near the tiki bar. She stops and stares at the cruise ship on the horizon before focusing her attention back on the weapon. Letting out a short sigh, Sariya continues her work in silence.</p>

<p>Closing an eye and inspecting the chamber on his weapon, he continues. &quot;Yep. Can't say I really feel any bad blood towards anyone here-not enough to draw killing intent, anyways. I always thought that in a situation like this I'd aim first, shut my eyes second.&quot;</p>

Still, society adapted, as we do. We formed new settlements in more secure, guarded locations... such as our lab, before it was raised. We lived on the slops of Scafell Pike.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A number of things. War was definitely one of them - when more of the world started to fall, conflicts inevitably rose up between those who remained. Some to poverty or famine when global supply networks were cut off. More were simply overrun by the living dead.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ours is a mix of the first and the last. The virus resurrects the body while the dark magic decays and controls the mind. What they did to me was cleansing me of any magic traces period before the virus' effect could kick in, which just resulted in me being raised like any other undead, just... sentient. Unfortunately this only works before the damage is done. One thing we were looking for was a way to repair the brain damage caused by zombification, but the brain is a complex organ and unlike everything else I'm not actually a good test dummy for that...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have never seen small arms up close before,&quot; the plane-person admitted. &quot;They refused to ever issue them to us, or at least in the time I was serving. Have you had breakfast already?&quot;</p>

<p>Vegael glanced over the parts, her eyes flickering between each one.
&quot;I do find this experience quite special, seeing the inside of a firearm isn't something I've ever...&quot;</p>
<p>She trailed off, as she processed what Sariya had said. The plane-person gave a look of sympathy to the woman.
&quot;Indeed, I recall you mentioned you were a foot soldier. As I've heard, fighting on the ground can be rather grisly. I only ever engage high-value targets from the air, so the aftermath is not something I have ever needed to confront.&quot;</p>

<p>Vegael pulled over a nearby chair, and took a seat in response to that question. She held out her wing, where the word was stamped, and looked back at Sariya. Her reply would come after a minute; it seemed she needed a moment to think about the question.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a long story, but... yes. When I had been expelled from the Air Force, they cut my wings. And to remind everyone that they had done so to me, this was done to what was left. I cannot remove them.&quot;</p>

<p>Vegael gave a sigh, and took a moment to collect herself.</p>
<p>&quot;I witnessed a wingmate getting shot down. And when I retaliated, as per my rules of engagement, I also found myself downed. The Air Force saw this as humiliating for their image; they blamed me for all of what had transpired. I believe it was politically motivated, but I never had the evidence to show that it was such...&quot;</p>

<p>Vegael flinched at the eye contact, but replied nonetheless.</p>
<p>&quot;As I had said, I retaliated. The situation there had been complex because there was an informal ceasefire in place - one that I strictly opposed, and wished to replace with a formalized one. But they had fired on us first, and downed my wingmate. So, I did what I had been ordered to do.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think that's likely your answer Sariya 'Korya' Kim. We have all done bad things in the past, and everyone deals with them differently. I don't think forcing someone to relive a bad experience to satiate our curiosity is the right way to go about things.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I understand wanting to learn about people's pasts, but especially in times like these we should try to focus on the good still in this world and things we can control. If people would like to share, that's wonderful, but if not I find it's usually best just to let it go.&quot;</p>

&quot;It's happening again,&quot; she said, her voice hushed. She spoke quickly. &quot;They're... everyone. They're all going to find out. I won't... I won't get a chance to explain what happened. I'm going to be shunned again, it's...&quot;</p>
<p>Her voice trailed off.</p>

<p>He, seeing her in this panicked state looks around and maneuvers to try and use his frame to block her from view of anyone on the beach, in hopes to give her a few minutes to recover without prying eyes.</p>
<p>He reaches out, careful not to overstep, and puts a firm hand on her shoulder.
“You were put in an impossible situation, a situation that requires split-second thinking. It’s hard to always make the right decision in those moments.”</p>
<p>He stops commenting on the subject matter itself for now and tries to reassure her.
“I don’t think all the others have heard yet, and I would assume at least some others can acknowledge the tough split-second decisions in war. The pain that can blind and send one into a rage.”</p>
<p>“I think if it does come up others will give you the chance to explain, people have come from all sorts of screwed-up places to this beach. Hell, pretty sure Matilda openly eats people, well bad people, but still. Everyone is put in situations that they cannot control and are sometimes forced to do things they would rather not do.”
“I’m not perfect either, and though some can’t learn to forgive themselves after making amends, I am proud that you have at least tried.”</p>
<p>He squeezes her shoulder gently to try and ground her and pull her out of the panic attack, staying crouched beside her, waiting as long as she needs.</p>

<p>Vegael had to take a moment to calm down. It seemed like she was on the verge of tears, the way her breaths shuddered. She wanted to say something, or it seemed that way at least, but she chose not to. She gradually stepped back to her feet.</p>
<p>&quot;What... what now?&quot; she murmured. She sniffled, wiped her eyes, and took a deep breath.
&quot;I thought... this place, at the very least, would be an escape from the past. Now... now even that minor respite is gone...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;While that is a logical assessment, I do tend to find myself leaning more towards the optimistic side of things these days.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can see how repeating familiar tasks can bring one comfort, for me I find cleaning to be a strong soothing force. Proof that I can control something in this world, albeit even just for a moment.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Blinding optimism can be a blessing and a curse.&quot;
&quot;Always looking for the best in people is noble, and quite frankly maybe a habit on my part, but even I in situations like these have trouble trusting some. I feel as though some here feel bound by their roles as if they have no other choice in the matter. I can't quite understand it myself, but the one thing I can understand is that people are rightfully scared. It hurts to watch.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You seem to be kind though, wishing to help your friends. That gives me hope and trust in you.&quot;</p>

<p>He looks down and takes a moment to think.</p>
<p>&quot;I haven't known you for long, but from my impression I would guess you did what you had to do to protect the ones you love and care about. You may have done some things you deem unforgivable, but if you are protecting someone you care about in my eyes you are still doing what you think is right.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone including myself has made mistakes. My past isn't so squeaky <em>clean</em> either, but you have to do what you can to make up for the wrongs. Don't beg for forgiveness from others, but at some point, you need to be able to forgive yourself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are still young and you are already trying to make amends, that's enough for me to think you are doing your best.&quot;</p>

<p>Booker emerges from his bungalow puffing his pipe and wiping the sleep from his eyes. He lets out a long stretch that creaks his aging bones in just the right way that with an audible pop he was left smiling and satisfied. As he walked the boardwalk he kept turning back to look at the massive white fortress out on the water. The opulent vessel was unlike any galleon he'd ever seen and he'd personally laid eyes on the excessively glamorous elven warships of his home world. Despite this raising a brow the smell of breakfast foods being cooked by his fellow islanders called to him like a siren song and he perked up at the sight of a kitchen ready-to-go with all the makings of a fine hobbit breakfast. Wasting no time he put his pipe away, washed his hands, and got to cooking.
Any onlooker would likely cringe after the 6th pancake was laid on top but the halfling didn't stop until there were 14 fluffy pancakes stacked on his plate. Having to stand on a stool to be able to effectively pour syrup he watched from above as the sugary liquid formed a moat between the pancakes and a ring of thick bacon strips he'd encircled them with. He passes by Jonathan before setting his food down at the bar getting ready to dig in.</p>
<p>&quot;Jonathan you beautiful, stern cyclops. Do you have any breakfast beers back there?&quot;</p>

<p>He peers around, looking at the various levels of excitement. He can only offer a shrug, commenting out loud to himself about the night being, well... quiet. &quot;Guess I missed a party.&quot;</p>
<p>Marshall strolls around the water for a bit, pacing himself back and forth near the shoreline. As is common, he seems pretty lost in thought, muttering to himself about something...</p>
<p>Until eventually, one of his boots catches something in the water, and he almost trips. He reacts so fast, the water barely has time to splash back down before his hand is already reached deep into the sand, trying to pull something out.</p>
<p>&quot;Hefty little fucker...&quot; he grunts to himself. With a few more tugs from this vacuum-like sand, it finally gives way. He wastes no time in removing all of the sand from whatever is in his hand, quickly clutching it to his chest in both hands.</p>

<p>Marshal looks over at Mr. Clean, giving a confirming nod as he holds it out for visual inspection.</p>

<p>&quot;It works like this:&quot;, he says, holding up a single finger. &quot;Longer I got it on me, the funnier the stuff I find is. Funny in the sense that it is <em>increasingly</em> destructive. Can't say I've ever been too worried about plain surviving after findin' it, just the manner of <em>how</em> I will.&quot;</p>
<p>Turning to Ferg, he says &quot;Think of it like this: Big stick that you can throw at a far away target.

<p>Marshal snaps his fingers, the index remaining in the air. &quot;Bingo! Excellent! Although... I guess I wasn't really thinkin' of a blood feud type thing. Not with that idiom, at least.&quot;</p>
<p>He pauses for a few moments, bringing his hand down to his side. &quot;I gotta wonder if you maybe live in more blessed times. Sure, we got all this cool stuff that makes things easier, but the world around me and its people are goners. Thinkin' about a world more alive leaves my chest beating like a real drum.&quot;</p>

&quot;Well friend, what do you make of it? I've come to learn it is known as a 'cruise ship' and that it normally holds many parties.&quot;</p>

<p>The d12 rolls with a slight clatter, settling with a soft thud on 4. The shopkeeper stretches, then slowly lifts their staff with no urgency. &quot;Well, that’s... unexpected. Not bad, just... unusual. I’ll process it eventually.&quot; They sigh deeply, giving a short nod, clearly finding this interaction a bit more engaging.</p>

<p>Strolling towards the tiki bar, with a little extra pep in her step, is Queen Elissandra - barefoot, her usually pristine dress a little bit sandy.  After last night's excursions, and a sunrise walk along the beach, she has worked up quite an appetite.
&quot;Sir Jonathan!&quot; she shouts when she is a few yards away from the bar, &quot;Do you happen to have any exotic coffees?&quot;</p>

<p>He gestures to her skirt.</p>
<p>&quot;Back in the 50's we had a version of this cleaner that's safe to use on clothes. I think we could use it to clean up the bottom of your skirt real quick if it is of a concern to you.

&quot;You don't say, it's beautiful out here today isn't it.&quot;
&quot;Let's get you that drink first though, shall we.&quot;</p>
<p>He politely call's out to Jonathan Bramblewood as to not immediately take over his Tiki bar again.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello Mr. Bramblewood, I believe miss Elissandra here could go for a coffee right now if you are up to making it.&quot;</p>

<p>After a few minutes he noticed Jonathan missing from the bar, he looks around to make sure and he slips behind the bar.</p>
<p>&quot;You know I can't guarantee this will be exotic, but Booker loved this earlier...&quot;</p>
<p>He pulls out the coffee machine again, plugging it in and rummaging around for the coffee to brew.
As he speedily works you begin to smell the aromatic scent of fresh coffee waft through the air.</p>
<p>As he places the cup under the spout and it starts dispensing, he looks up to you.</p>
<p>&quot;I think you're going to like this, but would you prefer it black or with cream and sugar?&quot;</p>

<p>The Unnamed One strolls over to the tiki bar, wearing his signature smirk. Perhaps it is the ambient IQ decreasing, or the pungent body odor that the wannabe badass emanates, but the air changes. Regardless, The Unnamed One stops and produces three oranges from his jacket pocket, setting two of them on the bar.</p>
<p>There's a quiet &quot;Hmph&quot; as he tosses the first orange up into the air, high above his head. He unsheathes Blight-Killer, the katana, and swings it at the peak of the orange's flight. The blade whistles through the air harmlessly, missing the orange completely, as the fruit plops smugly on the ground.</p>
<p>The Unnamed One looks around, a pink dusting on his cheeks as he catalogs who may have witnessed the blunder. He rolls his shoulder and reaffixes his smirk as he reaches over to the bar and grabs the second orange. He tosses it up into the air, a bit softer this time, and once again swings his sword. This time, the blade hits the orange and cuts into it. The citrus fruit proves too much for the blunt blade to handle, however, and the weapon only makes it partway through the orange before sending it spinning through the air.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, judging by The Unnamed One's triumphant smile, he seems satisfied with the result. He grabs the last orange, gritting his teeth with determination, and repeats the ridiculous exercise. The sword hits the orange once more, but only with the flat of the blade, which only serves to piss the orange off. It falls to the ground, defiantly intact, staring down its assailant.</p>
<p>The Unnamed One acknowledges the orange's bravery, even if it's futile. He tips his fedora, nods his head, before grabbing Blight-Killer. He swings the sword down in an executioner's stance and cuts the orange neatly in half.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, that's pretty good.&quot; He says, looking at the orange for a moment, directing his gaze back up towards you.</p>

<p>Kal-Ei approaches, and a lightning strike the ground. The sky darkens- or at least that's the feeling you get when you look towards him. Staring you down, he growls: &quot;Nice moves. But, we will see if you are worthy of the title of master.&quot;</p>
<p>He steps closer, his boots stomping on the creaky wooden boards. &quot;Here. Let us step up the challenge.&quot;</p>
<p>In front of him, he places a juicy, plump watermelon. &quot;CUT!&quot;</p>

<p>The Unnamed One's unnamed eyes light up at the next edible challenger. He readjusts his stance as he swings the sword with all his might.</p>

<p>Vegael was standing a good distance away, watching him slice oranges open with the sword... or try to, at least.

<p>TUO, pleased that his antics had the desired effect of attracting attention to himself, tips his head down so the fedora covers his eyes. &quot;The sword is the most honorable of weapons there is, M'lady. To wield Blight-Killer is to take up the mantle of chivalry.&quot;</p>

&quot;A transformer is an electric converter, are they not? I've targeted a few in the past, but I digress. If my wings weren't clipped and my engines still worked, I'd be able to take off into the sky right here, right now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Here friend, I once had a very good friend named Arm and Hammer and he worked on all sorts of products.&quot;</p>

<p>Jonathan heads into the larger resort building, fishing out a large trolley. He stacks it high with ales and wines, before pushing it over the sand. Strangely it seems as though the sand itself moves to provide a solid path for the wheels, and not a drop is spilled as he brings it to the celebration.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Kal-Ei is roasting a massive eel, easily almost ten feet in length, above the fire. &quot;Come on Vegael!&quot; He encourages from above. &quot;You may not need to eat but your taste buds are still working, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So, how does this all work? Throw us a hint!&quot; Kal-Ei asks while still hovering above them. &quot;Are you one of the previous survivors? Or were you chosen by the island in some way?&quot;</p>

<p>Jonathan looks up at him, expressionless. &quot;I am of this world. I found myself forcibly chosen by the island, against my wishes. Forced into the role of its caretaker, to manage these games for it, provide it with a human face.

<p>&quot;Others? Not to my knowledge, this is the only soul-hungering evil island I've ever heard of outside of fiction. But there are survivors, as I have been made to host these games once a year for over thirty years. It is those who survived a game but had only one goal completed, like how some of you may end up. They are... forced to become part of this world, generally unable to leave the island save by its permission.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, the other survivors <em>don't</em> work on <em>this.</em> They work on the daily maintenance of the resort. We're rated quite well online, you see, it's only for these two days out of the year that our residents go about murdering each other, or coming here from other worlds, otherwise we're quite luxurious. A fine place to bring the family. Or rather, families from this world. Victor is an oddball, really, but he's here to make your stay comfortable <em>before</em> the killing. Even were this resort not built here, mind you, you would still have been brought here in the annual event, running around in the jungle alone. So Victor will... make it more pleasant. And were you fighting here, would aid in cleaning up.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As for Mr. Clean's question, that ship is now anchored within the island's domain, which extends a fair distance out to sea.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And, Mr. Jim Jenkins, it's not really a choice I have. Unfortunately soul-eating monsters don't particularly care if you didn't agree to be their servant, they'll keep you all the same.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Some take it better than others. Some are suicidal, of course, and there have been a few staff murders, as others can't let the island's game go, but most are glumly resigned to their servitude. Quite bleak for them. A couple enjoy it. At the very least they're never involved in the actual death game itself again. And, of course, there is the annual one-week vacation.&quot;</p>

<p>Vegael had stepped aside, watching the sun near the horizon. It was beautiful. She knew what was next, everyone did. It wasn't going to happen immediately... but it <em>was</em> going to happen.
&quot;Alright, everyone, this is it,&quot; she murmured.</p>
<p>In one hand was a long, gray tube - about the size of a bazooka. It was rusted at several points, clearly in poor condition. One end of it had a few slim rockets poking out if it. She simply seemed to be examining it, as if in preparation.
&quot;I just wanted to say...&quot;</p>
<p>It wasn't quite clear who she was talking to. Perhaps, she was talking to herself. Or talking to whoever was in earshot. Or talking to everyone, even. She might've been a little desperate or scared, at that point.
&quot;If any one of us don't make it back home...&quot;</p>
<p>She glanced back at the resort's facilities.
&quot;It's been great.&quot;</p>

Mr. Clean is backstabbing basically everyone. Three people have told me he's the Macabre, so, well, yep... That's a thing. Also, fuck that guy. Nobody throws a friend into dragon fire and gets away with it. I'm about as useful dead as I am alive, I got nothing to lose and nobody gains a thing if I die. Fucking with this useless shopkeeper earns you nothing and I'll use that pedestal to call out some bullshit.&quot;</p>
<p>He takes in a deep breath and continues. &quot;You all needa chase the Macabre, Harbinger, Murderer, Champion, and Innocents, which, let's be clear as a bright and sunny day--I ain't any of those. Lick my dicey balls with a scrubber if that pisses you off. Destruction, your ONLY option is to kill Order. Go read this dumb ass game's rules. Chaos and Destruction have the numbers, but if this bald fucker backstabs everyone else even more, nobody but him and his Order friends win. It's fucking simple. Pick a few Order fucks to wipe out, you know, the one's actively backstabbing you all in private, and win this game. Two thirds of us can get outta this shithole if y'all just mop the floor with this walking talking detergent.&quot;</p>
<p>He offers a little bow. &quot;Good luck.&quot;</p>

<p>Some time after noon, Jonathan steps up from the bar. &quot;Forgive me, but the beach is to be closed while final preparations are made for your battle. Before I go though, the island has wished for me to remind you that you all have much to gain, if only you can complete the tasks that have been asked of you. Do not think it has nothing to offer you. It is not omnipotent, but it can do the impossible if satisfied. For those of you who have lost so much, it may be regained. Lives restored. Time turned back. For the ambitious, who wish for more, they too have been given a chance to make their dreams come true. If survival is all you wish for I cannot criticize you, nor can I condemn those who wish not to kill, I only wish to inform you that you will not get a chance like this again. Can some of you afford <em>not</em> to satisfy all the island's demands? Make this night count.&quot;</p>

<p>Vegael glanced at the sky. She had until morning to make a decision. That hardly felt like enough time.</p>
<p>She needed to defer to the survivors. Given Lamb's circumstances... well, she had been told that she could return home, if she wished for her wings to come back.</p>
<p>But she could bring someone back to life, forgo getting her wings fixed, and an ally here. That one... failing her friend, Korya, it cut deep. This was the second time she's ever let someone down like this. The exhaustion and emotions were beginning to catch up to her, with her Catharsis Drive winding back down. Now, her empty rocket pod was feeling heavier in her hands than ever.</p>
<p>Vegael simply did not know what choice to make. She needed to talk to... <em>someone.</em></p>

<p>Lamb walks up towards Vegael with the bird in her arms while Vegael looks to the sky. Once in front of her she simply sits down cross legged in front of her. The bird in her lap quiet as she strokes it.  She cocks her head to stare at Vegael as if a child waiting for a teacher to speak.</p>
<p>However after a few minutes Lamb doesn't give her the option to speak first. The emotionless mask staring up at her. &quot;The choice is yours. While life is temporary. Death is eternal. While those who are <em>immortal</em>&quot; The word scraped off her tongue like nails on a chalk board. &quot;Seem to live forever.. Even they must die. Life is not the norm. Merely the abnormal.&quot;
&quot;Even I must die. The vulture awaits its next meal.&quot; She said that last sentence almost to casually.</p>
<p>&quot;Would you want to bring someone back from their natural state just to have them return to it later?&quot;</p>
<p>She pauses a moment, just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. &quot;Should you decide to. Cherish the abnormality. But I will always be waiting. There will be no third attempt.&quot;</p>

<p>Vegael had been silent, as Lamb stepped up to her. She only spoke up once Lamb had finished speaking.</p>
<p>&quot;Morality, is it? I'm not a philosopher. I just know that there's been so much death today. Worst of all, halfway through this hellish excuse of a game, I almost felt acceptance over the fact I might die. But that's not how I want to live life. I never expected to genuinely <em>win</em>. Now that I have these options in front of me? There's no irony more cruel.&quot;</p>
<p>Vegael looked over to Lamb. There was this exhaustion, weariness in her heterochromic eyes. Her voice cracked as she neared the end of the sentence, but she held her composure.
&quot;Lamb. You have people waiting for you at home. Right? Words unsaid, questions unanswered. People who may rely on you. Tasks you needed done. A story you wanted to write. Anything of that sort?&quot;</p>
<p>It seemed to be a rhetorical question; the way Vegael framed it seemed she expected a <em>yes</em>. But the plane-person wanted an answer, anyway.</p>

<p>Lamb pauses for a moment. Her hand just above the bird she was patting. She then cocks her head at Vegael as if confused. &quot;hmm..... I feel every living thing is waiting for me <em>at home</em>. Wolf is at home.. Though who is wolf? I still do not know.&quot;</p>
<p>She continues to pat the bird. &quot;What of you? Who is waiting for you? And who is waiting for those who met their end tonight? Are they not treated as gone from their home?&quot;</p>

<p>Vegael nodded, hearing Lamb's answer. But she paused; the plane-person did not seem to expect the question to be directed back at her like that.
&quot;...I don't know,&quot; she answered. &quot;I don't know who is waiting for me. There might be someone, but I'm not sure. And I won't be sure, not until I go home.&quot;</p>
<p>She gave a slight frown at the last two questions.
&quot;Everyone who came to this island had people waiting for them. And giving me the option to revive only one of them? This place is trying to mock me. How <em>would</em> I even quantify that type of decision, if I were to? Do I now have to weigh the value of who is more of a friend, like they're hunks of gold?&quot;</p>
<p>Vegael glanced at the bungalows, and narrowed her eyes.
&quot;I can't. It's a false dilemma. That Bramblewood bastard gave me three options that were really only two. And, if you gave it a mere second thought, there truly is only one option for me. It's not a choice, it's a farce.&quot;</p>

<p>The lamb looks down at the bird in her lap before thinking for a minutes. Eventually she responds &quot;It all depends on what you value. I have no need for gold and silver but wolf is my value. Why value everyone the same? With thought, nothing has value. unless you decide so. Does that not help?&quot; while speaking she puts two fingers around the birds neck, closing it tighter and the bird squeaks as its being choked. Eventually when she says 'unless you decide so' she releases the grip and starts soothing the bird.</p>
<p>She looks up at Vegael the emotionless mask looks at Vegael as if looking through her. &quot;Even if you find someone of value. Will you see them again? There is always a choice. Even if it is an impossible one dear child.&quot;</p>

<p>Vegael seems a little perturbed by Lamb's treatment of the phoenix, but does not comment on it specifically.
&quot;I can agree on the subjectivity of value. But even then, there are different, non-tangible measurements of value. Do you value breathing air, or do you value drinking water? It does not matter, because one without the other is meaningless.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Cl.. <em>James</em> held concerns for your well-being. Given that he is... no longer with us, I feel an obligation to inherit those concerns. Before the night fell, I had asked Bramblewood what would happen to me if I were forced to stay here, considering that I am not quite a normal human. He could not give me a straight answer, and so, I came to the conclusion that I would likely die. He had mentioned that 'magical beasts' would transform into equivalent, unintelligent animals. Ergo, if I were to leave you here, then it would be no different than leaving you to die. Ultimately, you are a member of Order. I am not the type to toss one of our reasons for victory under the bus, because it has happened to me, personally, in the past.&quot;</p>
<p>The plane-person then looked down at her own flight suit, that was marked in red. She used a finger to trace the ugly rends that bordered where her wings had been cut off. Her voice softened.</p>
<p>&quot;But, it would be a lie if I were to say that you are the only factor. Bundled with your return home, is the return of my wings. I've dreamed of the day, ever since...&quot;
She trailed off. There was an air of guilt in her voice.
&quot;Is it selfish of me to wish for my own wings back?&quot;</p>

<p>while listening she cocks her head when Mr. James is mentioned as if she never heard that name and wonders who it was that cared for her. But then she straightens her head again to stare at Vegael.</p>
<p>Lamb continues to stare at Vegael before a simple. &quot;No.&quot;</p>
<p>After a moment she goes on. &quot;no, it is not. Being selfish is what keeps people from death dear child. It is merely a trait of survival. If I were to stay from your decisions. What can I do? It is your choice, I would simply become part of this place without a second thought. Mindless until I too, meet the Vulture.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The individual builds their own paths. Sometimes their paths and hard work are cut off by those with luck or smart choices. The choice is yours dear child. Will you give someone the tools to continue their path that has been cut off? Or turn yours from a small path in the jungle rarely tread to a village street that's marched every day which can help others continue onto their path?&quot;</p>

<p>Vegael listened to Lamb's assertion. Then, she gave a nod. The plane-person stepped up to Lamb, and clasped one of Lamb's (hands? paws?) into her own.
&quot;I see what you are saying, and I have made my choice. I... shall have you return home.&quot;</p>
<p>In the moonlight, the faint glistening of a few tears could be seen, streaming from the corners of Vegael's eyes.
&quot;...But, under the condition that you live your life to the fullest, henceforth. Please.&quot;</p>

<p>Lamb stares back at Vegael. The bright eyes of the mask more vibrant than ever.</p>
<p>&quot;Graunteed dear child. I...&quot; She looks down at the bird in her lap. &quot;Believe I have a task awaiting me that will be forever endless yet full of purpose.&quot; She looks back at Vegael for a moment and she cocks her head in realisation. &quot;All things must meet me eventually. Yet that is there not here. You will never see me at the end of your life. Maybe you will meet someone else. But I do not see an end for you.&quot;</p>
<p>She stands. places the bird neatly on the ground and gives a large formal bow to Vegael before picking the bird back up. &quot;I thank you dear child. I can feel I will soon find who my dear Wolf is. And the task I have to complete.&quot;</p>

<p>Vegael nods at the bow. There was a sad resignation in her eyes, but it seemed a weight lifted off her shoulders at Lamb's acceptance of her decision.
&quot;You are an interesting individual. I suppose, if we ever did meet again, we can talk about what's transpired since then? But the end of my natural life is a bit of a long ways off, despite my already advanced age.&quot;</p>
<p>The plane-person spoke with a little humor in her voice, at the last two sentences. She shifted her gaze to the phoenix that Lamb had placed on the ground, then picked back up.
&quot;What is that bird? It is quite striking in appearance. Is it... where did you get it?&quot;</p>

<p>When the handshake was extended to her, there had been a flash of several different emotions across Vegael's face -- first was anger, as the plane-person's hand suddenly clenched into a fist. Then there was grief, sorrow in her eyes. But exhaustion won out in the end, and those emotions dissipated like smoke from a burnt candle.</p>
<p>Vegael raised an arm, took Queen Elissandra's hand in her own, and shook it.</p>
<p>&quot;I... answer this for me, please,&quot; Vegael murmured. &quot;Her death. It was... it was quick, I hope?&quot;</p>

<p>The queen takes a deep breath, holding it in for what felt like several minutes before she responds, her voice low. &quot;She... her death was not particularly quick, or painless...&quot; her voice trails off as her lower lip begins to tremble, avoiding eye contact with Vegael as hers well up with tears. &quot;I was horrified by what Jim did to her... strangling someone...nevertheless, all cruel things considered, Sariya died a hero's death. I am sorry you have to find out this way.&quot;</p>

<p>Vegael's arm lowered, from the handshake. There was this hollowness in the plane-person's eyes as she listened to the Queen's confession.
&quot;I see. I will... I...&quot;
She took a shuddering breath.</p>
<p>&quot;Pardon me, it's just...&quot;
Vegael exhaled. Then, her gaze flickered back up to Queen Elissandra.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't hold anything against you. We all were just...&quot;
She trailed off yet again. It seemed to be difficult for her to put together words. She opened her mouth again, then closed it.</p>
<p>&quot;I'll... I'll be at the rooms. To gather my belongings.&quot;
But before Vegael could make it another two steps on her shaky legs, she collapsed to her knees. The woman buried her face in her hands, and her voice cracked as she gave a pained wail.</p>

<p>Ferg looks down at vegael from his perch on the rock. &quot;Ferg not sure...ferg not sure if ferg can.&quot; An ironic grin crosses Ferg's face, and his expression turns wistful. &quot;You know, Ferg always terrible hunter. other in tribe think it because ferg weak, or ferg no have skill to hunt, make too much noise or cannot aim knife well. False. Only Gir know truth. Ferg hate violence. Stupid, because ferg tribe need to eat. But ferg always hesitate, wait too long to throw knife or thrust spear. And animal escape.&quot; His eyes darken. &quot;Last night, ferg no hesitate. So if ferg go back to tribe, feed 100 babies good berry so they live instead of die from coughing sickness, ferg no think he <em>earned</em> anything. Ferg before that...&quot; he looks away from you, body shaking with rage, and slams his fist into the rock with a mighty cracking noise. A couple chips fly down in your face. &quot;<em>motherfucking</em> night...&quot; He pauses to compose himself. &quot;Old ferg would save those babies anyway. so if ferg do violence, if ferg lose...ferg, and ferg go back and help one hundred hunderd baby live, ferg no <em>earn</em> anything. To do good is not to earn life. To do good is...duty. duty of life.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ferg not sure it matter, what vegael choose.&quot; Ferg stands up, casting a shadow over the small plane girl in the dim morning light. He looks down at you again. You didn't see him draw it, but suddenly the Auroch hood is over ferg's head, obscuring his face. Still, his eyes shine out from under the cowl. &quot;Johnathan say vegael win. He lie.&quot; With a defeated sigh, ferg sits back down, no longer perched but lying languidly atop the rock. His hood falls away from his face, and the red morning sun glints off the tears slowly meandering down his cheeks. His hand lolls to his side and opens, and a shell necklace clatters down the rock into the sand beside you. Barely at a whisper, so softly that it could have been an illusion on the wind, you hear him say &quot;Island win. We all lose very moment fighting begin.&quot; He turns over and curls up on his side, his back to you.</p>

<p>Vegael listened to his words, but did not interject at all. She seemed either speechless, at a loss for words, or did not have any plans on what to say after that. She merely glanced up at his form, with the faded glow in her red right irises.</p>
<p>&quot;What's happened... happened,&quot; she murmured. &quot;That was how I've been taught to think. Lament over what's lost, move forth with what's left. It's a terrible philosophy to have for the sentimental, but I've never had the luxuary of learning otherwise.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But maybe... it's because I've made peace with the mere concept of doing horrible things before, so it does not weigh on me as much. I've lied to you, Ferg. Lied by omission, over why my wings have been clipped. I can say it was not my own fault, but I did do things that people thought... no, that <em>were</em> objectively terrible.&quot;</p>
<p>Vegael grasped some sand in her hands. It slipped through her fingers.
&quot;But you're right. I don't feel like much of a winner. Only thing that came out ahead here was the island, at all of our expense.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So&quot; Ferg says, pacing the floor of the bungalow, to the assembled audience all sitting on ferg's as-yet unused bed. &quot;you probably think 'why ferg gather us, like so many berries?' Well.&quot; Ferg stops pacing near the door. &quot;ferg tell.&quot; Ferg throws the deadbolt, locking the door against intrusion. Without moving, he looks down at the floor, and begins to speak: &quot;Ferg do things last night that ferg not proud of. Gir would not be proud of. Firrel...well, maybe firrel proud. maybe not. This scare ferg. make ferg think...bad thought. BUT. Vegael say something that make ferg think. Vegael say that we go, we earn good life by be better in future. Ferg think about this. Ferg agree and disagree. Ferg think 'if ferg leave island, ferg earn nothing. Island still win.'&quot; Ferg looks up, at all of you.</p>

<p>&quot;Last night, vegael 'win'&quot; He puts his hands up near his face in a not-quite-correct approximation of air quotes. &quot;Even ferg 'win' a little. But ferg no feel like winner. ferg no feel glory, or pride. Ferg feel like loser. Ferg think <em>island</em> win. So ferg realize that only way to earn good life is to keep fight. But this time, we fight island.&quot; He begins moving again, growing impassioned, fire rising in his eyes as he begins gesturing along with his words, increasing his volume and quickening their pace. &quot;Island offer ferg to go home, bring back gir. But nothing mean <em>fuck</em> (he emphasizes this, one of the many new words he has learned on the island) if ferg go home, ferg have gir again. Gir gone. Ferg have to move forward. So ferg stay. Ferg hide in woods, eat leaf and berry, and every time new group come to island, ferg lead he <em>own</em> faction, ferg try to show as many people he can that there is other way. Ferg hide and shelter player that no want to fight, kill. Ferg keep resisting.&quot; He finally slows to a stop. &quot;Ferg know that others have reason to return. Ferg no will think bad of you if you leave. But ferg no can go home anymore.&quot; A single tear slides down his cheek. &quot;So if ferg no can stay and fight, ferg will let island do to ferg what island want to do. Maybe I work for Johnathan. Maybe I...maybe I die.&quot; Ferg looks each of you in the eyes, one by one. &quot;Ferg can fight better with friend. Even if you no were friend to ferg, or ferg no to you, before, ferg will fight with friend, if you want.&quot;
&quot;So. Who is with ferg?&quot;</p>

<p>Vegael listened to his words. She gave a short nod, glanced at the ground, then looked back at the man.</p>
<p>&quot;I see what you are saying,&quot; she replied. &quot;I wish you luck in these endeavors, if you are looking to stay behind. However, I will not be able to accompany you with this.&quot;
She said that with more a resigned tone, than one of any judgement.</p>
<p>&quot;I have too much to do, too much to clear up in my homeworld.&quot;</p>

<p>Ferg does not seem deterred by this, in fact, he seems to light up after considering for a moment. &quot;this ok. So, vegael decide which of island's choices vegael take?&quot; Ferg seems to remember where you both are and take control of himself. &quot;Which you choose no matter. And not for ferg ears, maybe. Just remember shell.&quot;
Ferg turns to the rest of the assembled with a pointed look.</p>

<p>&quot;I would advise against that,&quot; Jonathan says, leaning in. &quot;Pardon the intrusion, I couldn't help but overhear. I hear most things. You will merely be offering the island your life as well. Don't leave your children, Ferg. Don't deprive them of a father too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you&quot; Ferg says simply, taking the necklace. He then snaps the cord over a table, letting the shells fall where they will.

<p>On the beach, just at the edge of the sand, lies a figure in a blue and white dress, gazing up into the clear sky. Queen Elissandra Morgaine Celestia Sakurai IV releases what feels like the heaviest sigh of her life as she closes her eyes and allows the remnants of incoming waves wash over her. A wide smile covers her face as she rolls over onto her belly; she no longer cares about her pristine appearance, her dress tattered and torn from the night's battles. She thinks about her beloved kingdom, and her two younger brothers back home, knowing that her exploits will surely be a grand story to tell. Slowly, she stands, and makes her way back towards the bungalows.</p>

<p>&quot;So you say I was chosen,&quot; Vegael replied. &quot;A powerful ability, it is, and a disgusting one given the nature of this island. I will not ask what more you know of me, as it will likely perturb me greatly. So instead, take this as a gift.&quot;</p>
<p>Vegael placed the now-empty rocket pod that she was carrying right next to Jonathan's leg.
&quot;I will be needing this no longer where I am going,&quot; she continued. &quot;So, you may keep it as a souvenir. It shouldn't be too heavy. Makes for a good mantelpiece. As for my decision, <strong>I want my wings back, and for Lamb to be returned to their home.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Jonathan glances at Lamb. “Truth be told, I didn’t expect this outcome. I believed her to be the type to dwell in the past. Count yourself lucky. I suppose I shall have to have Victor go back and grab you your gift basket.”</p>

<p>The plane-person glanced down, as her wings mended themselves, and the red permanent markings dissolved away. She extended her wings a bit, feeling at the sharp contours and edges. Then, taking a bit of a shaky breath, she glanced up at Jonathan.</p>
<p>&quot;If you knew as much as you claimed, then you will also know that I have been thrown under the bus, in the past. I would not do that to an ally, as little of them I may know.&quot;</p>
<p>Vegael then turned her back on the man, but gave a glance back.
&quot;Oh... and I forgot to mention. That rocket pod have some ammonium perchlorate, powderized aluminum, hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene, and hydrogen chloride residue on it. I don't know what that would do to a person in the long term, but I hope it isn't good.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uuuu...&quot; Paul comes out of the bathroom with a grimace. He's wearing a Hawaiian shirt that reads, &quot;I survived the Gateway Resort and all I got was this stupid shirt!&quot; It looks a little small, and the bottom button is open, accounting for his rotund figure. He's wearing a pair of boxers and holding his dirty, tattered overalls in one hand.</p>
<p>&quot;That was the worst night ever...&quot; He looks down, tugging lightly at the shirt. &quot;This doesn't even fit right. I wanna go home...&quot; He groans with a low ribbit.</p>
